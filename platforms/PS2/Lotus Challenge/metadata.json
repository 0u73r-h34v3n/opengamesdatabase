	"synopsis": "Lotus Challenge isn't about simply driving fast. To be part of Team Lotus you need to have style, panache, and skill as well. The game has you performing a number of astounding driving feats, ranging from jumping through trains on the set of a Hollywood blockbuster, to chauffeuring a pregnant woman to the hospital before she delivers. You can choose one of 42 cars to take you from the dusky streets of London to the neon-lit highways of Tokyo."
