	"synopsis": "Dog's Life lets you take on the role of a hound--one that can play fetch, sniff out food, and chase chickens, among other things. Set in the rural Midwest United States countryside, the game starts you off on a journey that spans the country and takes you everywhere from ski resorts to lively cities along the way. As Jake, a pup with a nose for adventure, you must solve a sinister dog-napping plot that involves the canine-hating Miss Peaches and Jake's pedigree friend, Daisy."
