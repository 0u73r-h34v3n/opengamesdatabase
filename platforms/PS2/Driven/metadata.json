DRIVEN is based on Franchise Pictures and Warner Bros.' recently released film, DRIVEN, starring Sylvester Stallone. Surrounded by fast cars, fame, money, and women, drive as Jimmy Bly and Joe Tanto of Team Spirit. Pitted against their archrivals, Beau Brandenburg and Max Manley, gamers will fight for survival.
