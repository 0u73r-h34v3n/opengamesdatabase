	"synopsis": "989 Sports ushers in the 2005 baseball season with a new installment in its baseball simulation series. MLB 2006 features a variety of gameplay enhancements, such as \"branch point technology,\" which provides smoother fielding transitions and baserunning; a fielding zone that matches a player's attributes with your skill level; and a \"pitcher confidence marker\" that helps determine your ability to hit spots in the strike zone. The game also enhances the series' franchise mode and introduces a career mode. Returning to MLB 2006 are EyeToy functionality, online playability, and voice recognition."
