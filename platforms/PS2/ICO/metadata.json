You are Ico, a boy ostracized and entombed for being born with horns, as he solves a variety of puzzles to escape from a dangerous castle. Ico can leap over precipices and battle shadow wraiths and ethereal creatures with a swing of his walking staff. With the help of his friend Yorda, Ico encounters many mysteries in his quest but one daunting question always remains: Is there ever a way out of this strange place?"
