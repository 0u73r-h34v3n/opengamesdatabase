	"synopsis": "Combine puzzles, sociopathic parrots, and monkeys, and you get Escape from Monkey Island. The fourth Monkey Island game begins when pirate-wannabe Guybrush Threepwood and his new bride, Governor Elaine Marley-Threepwood, return to Melee Island only to find out that Elaine has been declared dead, the Governor's mansion will be torn down, and a slick yet familiar politician is about to take Elaine's job. Amid this chaos, you'll solve challenging puzzles, meet new characters, and experience an all-new adventure on Monkey Island."
