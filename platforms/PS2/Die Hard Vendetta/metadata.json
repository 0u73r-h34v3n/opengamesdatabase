	"synopsis": "In Die Hard: Vendetta, tactics and stealth are just as important as having a big gun and being a quick shot. The story picks up five years after the movie Die Hard With a Vengeance, and you play as LA cop John McClane. Your daughter, now a full-grown woman on the police force, finds herself in danger, and it's up to you to save her. In your investigation, you'll meet old friends, uncover helpful clues, and solve objectives--all while using stealth or an arsenal of weaponry to move past enemies."
