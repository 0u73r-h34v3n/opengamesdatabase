	"synopsis": "When new leaders in Russia attempt to rebuild the Iron Curtain, war escalates, casualties mount, hostages are taken, and the Ghosts are sent in.  Take a highly skilled Ghost team through a series of missions that range from demolitions to search-and-rescue and all-out firefights for survival.  You can carry dozens of standard and special-issue weapons such as the M16A2, the M4 carbine, and the fearsome and deadly OICW.  Bring a friend into the firefight in split-screen multiplayer mode.  Your team--and the world--is counting on you."
