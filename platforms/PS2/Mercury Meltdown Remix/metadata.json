	"synopsis": "Mercury Meltdown is a brain-teasing puzzle game that challenges players to immerse themselves in a colorful world of sci-fi machines, crazy characters and bubbling test tubes. Players take control of a liquid mercury 'blob', guiding it around traps, door switches, spikes, moving floors and other hazardous elements in order to complete the level. Over 200 thought provoking levels - more than any previous Mercury title. Two never-before seen Labs. Dual analog control with Rumble feedback. State-of-the-art blob physics including normal mercury, solid, cold and hot forms. Freeform game progression. Hidden features to unlock."
