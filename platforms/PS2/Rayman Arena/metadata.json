	"synopsis": "Rayman Arena puts you in a competitive crash course. As any member of the cast of Rayman 2, you must smoke the competition on challenging race courses or incite a firefight in the battle arena. Take risks, use tricks, and trip up opponents as you sprint, slide, climb, and helicopter through 12 courses in an all-out rush for the checkered flag. Each of the gladiator-style arenas features its own set of power-ups, traps, and special ammo. You can also compete with up to four players in multiplayer action."
