	"synopsis": "Dead to Rights II marks the return of action-hero Jack Slate and his K-9 companion, Shadow. In this prequel, Jack and Shadow find themselves once again in the mean streets of Grant City, ensnared in a labyrinth of crime and corruption. The game features Hong Kong cinema-style action and new gameplay mechanics such as greater interaction with Shadow, disarm moves, a 360-degree fighting engine, melee weapon battles, and a dramatic spherical slow-motion diving system."
