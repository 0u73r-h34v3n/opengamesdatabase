	"synopsis": "Get ready for the big waves, swift currents, and treacherous downhill rivers of watercraft racing. Inspired by theme parks and thrill rides, Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild offers an even wilder experience than the original with imaginative locales, surprising events, and a stylized look. The Splashdown series evolves with indoor stadium courses, a freestyle stunt mode, and a new technical time-trials mode. The game combines realistic physics and controls with arcade fun, creating a watercraft experience for all types of racers."
