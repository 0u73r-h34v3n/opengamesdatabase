A new breed of \"cowboy\" bounty hunters pursue outlaws across the lawless solar system in the hope of receiving high rewards for the hackers, drug-dealers and terrorists they capture.

Use Spike's Jeet Kune Do skills or Jet's bulldog-style fighting techniques to defeat more than 50 different outlaws and then reap the rewards."
