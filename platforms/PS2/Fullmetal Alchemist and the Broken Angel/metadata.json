The story takes place in a lost chapter from the series during the Elric brothers' journey to Central City. Together, they'll search for a sacred stone that can transform them back to their original state. Now you can join the brothers as they battle across different areas featured in the show. The game's battle system lets you equip your subcharacter with new items and call him or her for help in battle."
