	"synopsis": "The 6th game in the Dokapon RPG series. Dokapon the World is the first and only game in the series that takes place in the real world. Board game for up to four players based on the Japanese roleplaying franchise, Dokapon. Gameplay mixes traditional board game style movement with turn-based RPG battles. Players spin roulettes, then move according to the number they get. If a player lands on a monster field, he has to battle enemies via the game's turn-based RPG battle system. Players can use four different special skills during the fights, which are mapped to the four face buttons for easy access. As they progress through the quest, players can change jobs from a poll of 45 different occupations. Characters are presented in a unique paper cutout style, with thick white frames around the outline. Two primary modes of play are included: a single player mode in which you work through a story as one particular character and a multiplayer mode playable by up to four players simultaneously."
