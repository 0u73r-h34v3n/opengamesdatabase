	"synopsis": "Join anti-Umbrella search and pursuit team agent, Bruce MacGavin, as he encounters a new layer of Umbrella's insidious activities.  In this all-new Resident Evil first-person action-shooter, you must search, sneak, and use battle moves to regain control of a sea-jacked cruise ship lost in the Atlantic.  As you progress through the game, you'll be able to upgrade your weapon.  And should you find yourself trapped amongst hordes of zombies and mutant beasts, your aim better be dead on--or you're gone."
