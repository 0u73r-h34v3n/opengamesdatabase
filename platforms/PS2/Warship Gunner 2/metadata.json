	"synopsis": "In the sequel to the naval action sim \"Naval Ops:Warship Gunner\", video gamers engage in deadly sub-to-sub stealth warfare, pilot classic warships and design their own fleet of destroyers, submarines, and battlecruisers. With KOEI's strategic twist on naval action, Warship Gunner 2 lets players invest in new technologies to develop a full spectrum of artillery systems, aircraft, ship hulls, propulsion and electronics. Over 1000 vital components in all. Combat in Warship Gunner 2 takes place across 100 missions and 60 stages teeming with lethal seafighters, swarms of enemy aircraft, and unworldly super-weapons. Using the game's control panel and advanced heads-up display, players must track their targets through darkness, varying sea states and the most adverse weather conditions known to man."
