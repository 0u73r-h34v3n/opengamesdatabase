	"synopsis": "In God of War, the dark world of Greek mythology comes to life right before your eyes. As you take the role of Kratos, a story unfolds with various plot twists and multiple endings that take you through traps, stunts and puzzles. With a deep combat system built around double chain blade weapons, the game places you in a variety of environments where you must fight challenging enemies, swing on ropes, scale mountain cliffs, swim through rivers and slide down zip lines."
