	"synopsis": "Eagle Eye Golf is a golf simulator. Play many different game modes to improve every ability necessary to win the tournament. This title is also very customizable: you can create a golfer as you like and even edit courses from scratch. At least three different environments await you: desert, grass and reef, use every object to create your dream course. If you want you can re-edit the entire game and save it! Beautiful trees moving by wind and birds flying through the sky complete the stage. Play a real simulation in a realistic environment."
