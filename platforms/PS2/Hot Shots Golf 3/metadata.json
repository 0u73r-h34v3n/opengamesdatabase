	"synopsis": "Play golf without all the restrictions of a stuffy resort.  The third installment in the Hot Shots Golf series features all the off-the-wall characters, entertaining caddies, and trash-talking that would normally get you kicked off a pro golf course.  Now you'll have 15 characters to choose from including seven caddies to entertain you--no matter how bad your score is.  Earn \"green points\" to buy enhanced golf equipment and insane golf gadgets.  Hot Shots Golf 3 puts the fun back into golf."
