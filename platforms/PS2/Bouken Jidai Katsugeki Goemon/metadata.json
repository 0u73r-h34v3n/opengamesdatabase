	"synopsis": "the player assumes the role of Goemon, who is set once again to save Japan. Goemon is able to use a large variety of weapons (including his trademark pipe), as well as equip sub-weapons, items and magic, which can be assigned in 4 hexagons for quick use. Another twist is the addition of a white tiger known as Kotora, whom Goemon can use to attack enemies when he locks on them."
