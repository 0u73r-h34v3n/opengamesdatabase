	"synopsis": "It's all about the chromed-out cars, jewelry, ladies, tattoos, and jets in NBA Ballers, the basketball game that highlights both the one-on-one confrontation and the glamorous lifestyle of NBA superstars. Choose from current and legendary NBA players, such as Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Magic Johnson, and Wilt Chamberlain, and face-off in some lavish player home courts. Although the game focuses on the one-on-one experience, you can also play in one-on-three and special-rules matches. After the tournaments, spend your winnings on anything from licensed cars to expensive mansions."
