	"synopsis": "Throw a cat, mouse, and more than 75 weapons in the same room and you're sure to have a war. Tom & Jerry: War of the Whiskers lets you choose from nine different characters, including Jerry the mouse and his feline nemesis Tom. You then duke it out in 11 destructible environments--battlefields which range from a twisted laboratory to an unstable construction site. Each character has their own strengths, weaknesses, and moves, but skillful use of weaponry can quickly turn a match in one's favor."
