The game plays as a fully 3D arena fighting game which implements common fighter features such as ''basic moves and combos'', ''guard and counter guard system'', ''a \"Sexy\"/\"Love\" meter system which allows an enhanced countering (unleashes a quick counter move automatically after guarding against the move) action and, when full, provides a super move called \"Sexy Dance\" which unleashes a powerful combo.''"
