	"synopsis": "You're invited to the Mary-Kate and Ashley's sweet 16 birthday bash.  Head to the DMV, earn your license, and then put the pedal to the metal.  In true Hollywood style, go racing in cars, jetskis, sailboards, and ATVs.  The party continues with over 30 minigames, including Birthday Blowout, Caught Up in Fashion, and Freeway Frenzy.  Invite up to three of your friends to celebrate with head-to-head competition.  Mary-Kate and Ashley will turn 16 only once, so with some friends, two game boards, and a slew of vehicles, this will be a day to remember."
