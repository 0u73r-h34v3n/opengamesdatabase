	"synopsis": "NBA Shootout 2004 lets you play with the NBA elite. Build a dynasty of the ages with current NBA stars or legends such as Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, or Clyde Drexler. Career mode allows you to create a player, join the Summer Pro League, earn a spot in the National Basketball Development League, and work your way through the ranks to get signed by the NBA. This year's NBA Shootout also gives you more control over plays with mid-air shot changes and mini-plays."
