	"synopsis": "It's the 25th century and you must dance to save the universe. As intergalactic space reporter Ulala, you'll battle wicked aliens called Morolians, who have attacked and subdued Earthlings with their dance-inflicting ray guns. The Morolians' hypnotic grasp can only be broken by mimicking the aliens' exact dance moves and keeping the beat with pauses timed to perfection. In addition to dancing, you'll also have a musical instrument and Ulala's singing voice as weapons against these evil invaders."
