	"synopsis": "Gungrave casts you in the role of Grave, a long-dead assassin sent to annihilate a mysterious criminal organization. The tools at your disposal: a gun in each hand and a coffin full of hardware strapped to your back. Gungrave features an intuitive control system that lets you perform a variety of graceful moves, all while unloading more bullets than in a John Woo flick."
