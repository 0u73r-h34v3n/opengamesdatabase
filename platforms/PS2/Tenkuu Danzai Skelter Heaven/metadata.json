	"synopsis": "A love adventure game that has you, Atsuya Funagai -- a 25-year-old member of a futuristic outfit being attacked by giant squid creatures -- training a squad of five females to become pilots of Skelter mech units. Battle the enemy with the game's Interactive Command Assist battle engine (a semi-action-based battle system) and engage in conversation with the your team members. The game features interactive conversation sequences in which you attempt to improve your favor with the girls as well as training scenes where you help the girls out in battle. In the \"ICA\" (Interactive Command Assist) battle system, you move a cursor around the screen to take out targets, helping the girls grow. The game's ending changes depending on which girl gets most of your attention. "
