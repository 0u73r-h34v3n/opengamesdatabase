	"synopsis": "Zero no Tsukaima: Muma ga Tsumugu Yokaze no Nocturne (English - The Familiar of Zero: Dream Demon's Spinning Fantasy of the Night Wind) is a visual novel developed and published by Marvelous Entertainment for the PS2.  Released in 2007, it is the second of three Familiar of Zero visual novels.  The story is a separate continuation from the anime and follows the adventures of Saito and Louise after becoming friends with Christina Vasa Ricksell Oaksenshelluna, the new transfer student at the Tristain Academy of Magic.  Strangely Christina claims to be a samurai, which surprises Saito as samurai are something from Japan and not Halkeginia.  Saito and Louise set off on a new adventure to find out more about Christina and why she has come to the academy as well as a strange dream Saito is having where he and all of his friends live back in Japan.  A notable change from the first entry in the series is the removal of the turn based combat sections."
