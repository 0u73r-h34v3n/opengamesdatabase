Set in the distant future, the game continues the adventure of the legendary hero, Bill Rizer, and introduces a new character to the series--Genbei Jaguer Yagyu, a mysterious samurai. As Bill or Genbei, you'll fight huge bosses and deadly enemies with an arsenal of powerful weapons. Neo Contra also features realistic environmental destruction, explosions, and cinematic cutscenes."
