	"synopsis": "The Dragon Warrior series makes its debut on the PlayStation 2 with Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King. You can play as a young guardsman who must fight against a curse that he is mysteriously immune to. Characters in the game are designed by the creator of the Dragonball characters and are cel-shaded to provide an \"anime\" feel. The game is set in a large 3D world ravaged by the effects of the curse. The game also includes a playable demo of Final Fantasy XII."
