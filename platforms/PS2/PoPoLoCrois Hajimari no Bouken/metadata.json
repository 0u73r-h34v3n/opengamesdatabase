PoPoLoCrois: Hajimari no Bouken follows the story of Pinon PakaPuka on his journey as the new prince of Popolocrois. Pinon PakaPuka is a white haired kid who would rather read and study than practice swordplay, go to school, or make friends. He is often compared to his father, Pietro, because everyone expects him to be as great as Pietro was when he was young, but Pinon hates the fact everyone is expecting too much from him. He meets the aqua haired girl named Luna after she saves him from drowning. Luna seems to know about Pinon, and Pinon doesn't know how."
