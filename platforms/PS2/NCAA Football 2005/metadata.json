For the first time in the series, the game-day atmosphere directly affects players' on-field performance. Create mismatches with the new Match-Up Stick, and then celebrate big plays with new fan celebrations, like the Gator Chomp and the Texas Hook 'Em Horns. NCAA Football 2005 also features online tournaments, a deeper Dynasty mode, and a host of other gameplay enhancements."
