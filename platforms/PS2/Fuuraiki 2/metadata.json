	"publishers": ["Fog"],
	"regions": ["NTSC-J"],
	"synopsis": "Once again, you are in the role of a travel blogger and photographer who, after the good online response to your Hokkaido trip (in Fuuraiki 1), are now given a similar assignment in Okinawa. You are free to travel around the island, with around a hundred different locations to visit and several different girls to encounter on your journey. The gameplay is quite similar to the previous game, with a particular focus on the visual novel aspect. Much of the incidental music from the original is repurposed here, and the sequel also keeps to the original's style of anime-style artwork superimposed into actual photographic backgrounds of real-life locations."
