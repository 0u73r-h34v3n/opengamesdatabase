	"synopsis": "Reservoir Dogs is based on the 1992 Quentin Tarantino-directed classic movie about five total strangers who are brought together to carry out a diamond heist. The robbery goes wrong when the alarm is tripped and the cops show up. In the ensuing confusion, four of the robbers make it back to their warehouse rendezvous but it is quickly apparent that one of them is an undercover police officer - but which one? Staying true to the original plot, this intense, third person shooter follows the progress and planning of the famed diamond heist while filling in some of the cliffhanger questions from the film: What happened to Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown? Where did Mr. Pink hide the diamonds? What actually happened at the heist? These questions and more will be answered as the game unfolds and according to the player's tactics. Players get to fill the shoes of each iconic character in the film as they relive the Reservoir Dogs experience complete with the movie's trademark style and wit. The game will also feature the full and original soundtrack from the movie - the super sounds of the seventies brought alive with the thematic \"Little Green Bag\", \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" and more."
