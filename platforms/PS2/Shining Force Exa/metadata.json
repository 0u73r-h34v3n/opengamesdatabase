With both sides deadlocked, two young heroes rise up to begin a heroic journey to stop the fighting and unite the divided world. As Toma, a talented sword fighter boy or Cyrille, a cunning female sorceress, you'll venture into a stunning world of swords and sorcery teeming with a huge variety of tribes. With aggressive offensive and defensive strategies you'll lead your battle party into combat while protecting your home base, the Geo Fortress, from massive attacks."
