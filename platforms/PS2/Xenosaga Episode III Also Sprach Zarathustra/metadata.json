	"synopsis": "The story of Xenosaga III starts a year after \"Xenosaga II\" ended. Shion has resigned from Vector Industries after learning that the company is deeply connected to the appearance of the Gnosis. She instead joins Scientia, an underground organization working to unveil Vector's secrets in order to bring them down. Uncover the truth and save mankind in the finale of the Xenosaga series which boasts over 3 hours of movies, an updated battle system, and an improved customization feature with more in-depth character specialization and diversification and higher rewards for strategic party management. This RPG also includes an easily accessible database feature, the \"Xeno Bible\" and a mini-game with over 50 levels that challenges both you and your friends."
