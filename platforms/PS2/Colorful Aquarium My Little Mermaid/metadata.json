But now that she's gone as well, you're left alone in the house, doing the chores and going to school. Your childhood friend, Izumi, is staying with you to help you with chores, though the two of you often get into quarrel. One day, a girl with two maids come to your house. While at first you fail to understand why she treats you like she knows you, you soon recognize her as she was another childhood friend of yours you haven't seen in ages. Now, what felt like living alone will soon turn into living with a bunch of girls, any of them capable of stealing your heart."
