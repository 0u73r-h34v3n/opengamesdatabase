	"synopsis": "RoadKill presents an action-packed, mission-based combat driving experience.  To survive, you must out-drive, outgun and outthink rival gangs, city guards, and anyone else gunning for you in the living, post-apocalyptic territory of Hell County.  With the ability to build up a powerful gang following, you'll unleash havoc, chaos, and destruction on the environment and its inhabitants with a wide selection of vehicles, a potent armory of weapons, and special equipment in both single-player and various multiplayer game modes."
