	"synopsis": "In Mystic Heroes, it's up to you to find hidden Runes that will help you defeat an enemy army. As one of four main characters, you'll battle through Mt. Hoshin, Mt. Senkai, and The City of the Ancients. In each stage, you must equip your Runes strategically in order to defeat powerful enemies and bosses. The more Runes you gather, the more spells you unlock and levels you advance. There are 70 total Runes hidden throughout the single-player missions and multiplayer modes."
