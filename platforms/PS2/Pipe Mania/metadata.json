	"synopsis": "The simplicity of Pipemania makes it accessible to all ages. The player must lay down a pre-ordained set of pipes on a tiled grid in order to keep the constantly flowing Flooze moving for as long as possible without it spilling out. The game requires quick thinking, hand-eye co-ordination, forward thinking and keen spatial awareness."
