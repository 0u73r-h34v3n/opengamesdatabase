	"synopsis": "Billed as a \"music clip\" game, this interactive music and mini-game collection is based on the tennis-themed manga of the same name. Released in time for Valentine's Day 2004, the game comes in two flavors: Sweet and Bitter. Each version features a cast of 20 characters, 10 of which are exclusive to one version. The cast of the game is all male - which makes sense if you're familiar with Japanese Valentine's Day customs. In Japan, the girls give boys chocolate (that's where the bitter/sweet comes in) for Valentine's Day. It's the boys' turn to return the favor on White Day a month later, and it's customary to give white underwear and/or white chocolate. "
