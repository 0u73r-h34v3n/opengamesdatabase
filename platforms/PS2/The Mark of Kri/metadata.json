Before the spell could be invoked it was stolen and hidden away, forgotten with time... until now.  Follow Rau, a heroic warrior, as he embarks on an adventure filled with conflict, discovery and magic. Accompanied by his loyal friend, a bird named Kuzo, Rau must battle many enemies across lands near and far to uncover the truth about his family's dark secrets."
