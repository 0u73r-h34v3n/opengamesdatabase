	"synopsis": "HSX HyperSonic.Xtreme antigravity racing is all about speed. Ten different racers in the game share the same mission--to stay on the track and finish in first place. Of course, there can only be one winner and only those with superior racing skills have a chance at the top spot. To increase your chances, you can collect power-ups that increase speed and regenerate shields. Tear through the tracks in single-player or multiplayer head-to-head modes, or create your own track anywhere in the world."
