You'll play Mark Hammond (an ex-bank robber on the run for murdering his wife and kidnapping his child) and Frank Carter (a vigilante cop who was suspended from the Flying Squad) in multiple storylines set in London. Within the city's winding streets, indoor environments, and dangerous street corners, you must search for the manipulative crime boss and finally clear your name."
