	"synopsis": "NFL GameDay 2002 features new gameplay with Total Control Passing and all-new tackles, drag downs, and blocking moves. The incredible new motion-capture and player models are accurate for every athlete, and include true-to-life faces and improved visual textures with realistic clothing and environments that show off every wrinkle and seam in player models. The game also features play-by-play by Dick Enberg and color commentary by Dan Fouts. NFL GameDay 2002 benefits from game input from Philadelphia Eagles Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb."
