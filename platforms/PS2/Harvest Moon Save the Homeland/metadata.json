	"synopsis": "In the past, Harvest Moon was more of a farming simulation with a little bit of role-playing added in. Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland takes the series in a new direction, by offering a deeper and more robust role-playing experience. The object of this game is to save the village from being turned into a resort. Unlike previous Harvest Moon titles, Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland has a stronger focus on developing relationships with the townsfolk, and it offers nine unique ways to complete your task."
