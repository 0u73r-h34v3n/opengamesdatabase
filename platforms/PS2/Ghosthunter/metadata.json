	"synopsis": "Rookie Detroit cop Lazarus Jones is thrust into the role of Ghosthunter after a routine patrol at a derelict high school goes awry. Lazarus and partner Anna Steele stumble upon the supernatural research center of Professor Peter Richmond, where they unintentionally liberate a legion of poltergeists. A deadly spirit abducts Anna, while another ghost fuses with Lazarus, giving him the ability to see into the realm of the dead. Armed with second sight and a cache of weapons and gadgets, the idealistic cop is forced to take on the entire spirit realm in hopes of finding his valued partner--and saving the world."
