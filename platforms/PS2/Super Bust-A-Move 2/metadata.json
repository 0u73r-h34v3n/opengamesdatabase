	"synopsis": "Bust-A-Move is back with more bubbles, modes, and challenges than ever. In Super Bust-A-Move 2, you must clear each puzzle by connecting bubbles of similar colors, causing them to pop. Now, you can use Big Bubbles and a spinning game frame to help you clear each stage. Try your bubble-busting skills in Story mode, where you guide a character through five challenging levels all the way to the top of the legendary Bubble Tower. Whether you play single-player or multiplayer head-to-head modes, Super Bust-A-Move offers fast-paced fun for all ages."
