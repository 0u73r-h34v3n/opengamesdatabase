Using an enhanced \"Tomb Raider Legend\" game engine, the graphics, technology and physics bring Lara's adventure and pursuit of a mystical artefact known only as the Scion up to today's technology standards and offer gamers a completely new gameplay experience. The puzzles are now more in depth and incorporate environmental interaction and physics driven solutions. The level design and flow of gameplay are inspired by the original videogame making Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary a brand new experience in gaming, while still invoking the nostalgia of the first adventure in Tomb Raiding."
