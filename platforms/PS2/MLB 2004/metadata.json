	"synopsis": "This year's entry in the MLB series adds more authenticity to the baseball experience with new modes, detailed stadiums, and fresh commentary. In MLB 2004, you can build yourself an unbeatable dynasty with Franchise mode, take your favorite team or player through a ten-year Career mode, manage the front office in General Manager mode, or take a rookie from A-Ball to the big leagues in Spring Training mode. Replays, play-by-plays from Vin Scully, and commentary from ESPN's Dave Campbell, enhance the action from Opening Day to the Fall Classic."
