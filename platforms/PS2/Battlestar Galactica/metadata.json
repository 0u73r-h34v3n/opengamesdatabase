Begin your heroic journey through the Battlestar Galactica universe as the fearless, young Adama, and help lead the fleet of Colonials to survival. Choose from a wide array of ships, from sleek Vipers to heavy Bombers, and engage various classes of Cylon vessels, including Raiders and Marauders. As you attack, escort, or defend, your team of three wingmen will increase in experience and skill."
