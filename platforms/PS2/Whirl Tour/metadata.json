	"synopsis": "Flipside is giving a stunning performance at Castle Coliseum. Suddenly, in the middle of the band's finale an audible power surge occurs, and lightning strikes each of the 6 band members. One after another they are vacuumed into the sky. The band's readie shakes his head in disbelief. \"I have to find them!!!\" He jumps through a color-shifting portal, grabs his scooter and rides off to search for his idols."
