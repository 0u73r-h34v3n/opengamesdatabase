	"synopsis": "The classic 1987 arcade shooter gets a complete makeover in R-Type Final.  While it does include all-new features, such as the Force System and AI Mode, it still retains some of the classic gameplay that started it all.  Use the Force System to power-up your ship and battle against the evil Bydo.  Over 100 ships are available for you to choose from and customize.  Save your ships on a memory card via AI Mode and battle head-to-head against the computer or your friend's machines."
