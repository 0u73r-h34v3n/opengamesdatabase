	"synopsis": "NCAA Football 06 is a 3D college football simulation. You assume control of a college football franchise and make decisions concerning recruiting and coaching strategies, and then play out the game on the field. The new 'Quest for the Heisman' mode lets you follow a star player from high school training camp through the Heisman awards ceremony. NCAA Footbal 06 also features impact players and a breakaway mode, which gives you more control during clutch moments in the game."
