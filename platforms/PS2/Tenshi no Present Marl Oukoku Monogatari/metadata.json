	"synopsis": "Tenshi no Present: Marl Oukoku Monogatari is the first ''Marl Kingdom'' game released for the PS2. Instead of the 2D graphics of the other Marl games, Tenshi no Present uses 3D backgrounds with 2D character sprites. Tenshi no Present, unlike the earlier games in the series, consists of six separate chapters, each of which features different characters from the Marl Kingdom series. The chapters take place in various times before or after the stories of Rhapsody and Little Princess. These chapters often address unanswered questions from the earlier games, or provide additional insight into the characters. Tenshi no Present is a typical RPG, complete with experience points, parties of characters, and spell casting. In each chapter, the player guides different characters through their adventure, engaging in several battles along the way. "
