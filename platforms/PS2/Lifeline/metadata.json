	"synopsis": "In Lifeline, you'll battle deadly creatures, solve puzzles, and escape from a space station--all with the sound of your voice. Trapped in the station's control room after a massive attack, you must use verbal communication--through the USB headset--to guide a female survivor, named Rio, around a hostile hotel environment. Voice commands, such as \"shoot and reload,\" \"dodge to the left,\" \"look behind you,\" and others, will come in handy as you battle vicious aliens."
