	"synopsis": "Protect America and freedom from enemy forces in urban and rural warfare in SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault, which features all-new 4-player cooperative play, improved enemy behavior and tactics, and new vehicles and weapons for campaign mode. Command the most feared Special Forces team ever assembled through a single, massive Area of Operation with varied missions spanning across multiple diverse regions. Players can experience the campaign mode in single player or in 4-player online cooperative mode. Additionally, players have the option to select an individual tactical mission area that was previously completed, and play it as a stand-alone, or 'Instant Action', mission in 4-player online cooperative play. Players can then customize these Instant Action missions for nearly endless replay. SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault also contains the full \"SOCOM 3: U.S. Navy SEALs\" multiplayer online game with all maps, patches and updates included and it is completely compatible with SOCOM 3 Online multiplayer. In addition it features new competitive 32-player maps, exclusive to SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault. Improved Crosstalk functionality between SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2 and SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault allows each game to have even more dramatic effects on the progression of the other, in addition to unlocking special features across the titles."
