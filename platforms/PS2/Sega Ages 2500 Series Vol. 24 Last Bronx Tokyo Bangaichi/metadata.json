Problem is, the rule doesn't mention taking to the streets with sticks, poles, nunchukus, or tonfas. Master your weapons or step out of the way. Do battle with 8 authentic martial arts weapons. Choose from 8 kick-butt fighters. Eye-popping 60fps hi-resolution graphics. Five unique gameplay modes, seriously enhanced from the kicking Sega coin-op game."
