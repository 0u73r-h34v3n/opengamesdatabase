	"synopsis": "Joe is no ordinary man and Viewtiful Joe is no ordinary game. Capcom's new superhero action game mixes funky cartoon-style visuals with classic side-scrolling gameplay and introduces the world's quirkiest million dollar action hero. More than just any ordinary dude, Joe must transform into the ultimate superhero. It's up to you to activate the correct view mode like \"slow\" or \"zoom in\" in order to clobber your enemies with beautiful style. You can also speed up or slow down your visual effects for even more \"viewtiful\" moves. Viewtiful Joe mixes an innovative viewpoint with an amazing stunt-filled action movie universe."
