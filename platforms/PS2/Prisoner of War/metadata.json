	"synopsis": "Prisoner of War captures the intrigue, danger, and heroism of Allied escape attempts from prisoner of war camps during World War II, including Colditz--the Germans highest security \"escape-proof\" camp. As one of Germany's prisoners, Captain Stone, you'll embark on an adventure across Germany in a variety of different POW camps. Outwit the German war machine by crawling through muddy tunnels and over stone walls and using disguises and makeshift equipment to escape. In this third-person adventure, bravery, stealth, and cunning will win the day."
