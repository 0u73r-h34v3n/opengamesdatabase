	"synopsis": "Forbidden Siren 2 is a haunting tale set on the island of Yamijima. The story starts as a group of characters are washed up on the island's shore after their boat is caught in a violent storm. Unbeknownst to them, 29 years earlier, all the inhabitants of the island mysteriously disappeared in a black-out. Up until now, the events of that ill-fated night remain unsolved. But as the chilling sound of a warning siren rings out over the island, the castaways are faced with the awakening of the Shibito (living dead) and the Yamibito (people of the dark).<br>"
