	"synopsis": "Max Payne is a man with nothing to lose--a fugitive undercover cop framed for murder, and now hunted by the cops and the mob.  As Payne, you'll uncover plot twists, engage in dramatic \"bullet-time\" firefights with thugs, and fight your way through an unforgiving New York blizzard.  Max can wield a variety of weapons including pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenades, and Molotov cocktails.  Prepare yourself for an involving story combined with slick action."
