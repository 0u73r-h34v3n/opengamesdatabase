In the game the player controls Daisuke Niwa, the protagonist of the series, who has inherited the ability to turn into a phantom thief. The game is a mixture of typical visual novel character dialogue screens and 3rd-person isometric perspective puzzles where the player controls the protagonist directly. Voice-acting was done by the same actors from the anime TV series."
