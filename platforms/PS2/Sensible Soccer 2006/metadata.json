	"synopsis": "The all-new Sensible Soccer comes complete with lightning fast football action, mesmerising dribbling, physics defying sliding tackles and, most famously, a huge amount of unbelievable goals, that can go curling into the top corner, thanks to the outrageous levels of after-touch. Sensible Soccer 2006 returns with a modern take on its trademark zoomed out camera and truly intuitive control system, which delivers total 360-degree control over your players' kicks and movement. Visually, the game has a distinctive new graphical style, which includes cel-shaded players with the classic enlarged heads, designed to appeal both to fans of the series and appeal to a new generation of gamers. The trademark top-down view allows you to see the build up play better than you can in any current football game. This gives the player a huge degree of tactical awareness and control that has never been bettered."
