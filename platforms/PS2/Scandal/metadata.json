	"synopsis": "Scandal is an interactive anime movie, much like Triangle Again games, which puts you in a role of a freelance photographer, Saki Kitazawa. While your father was a professional in the same line of work, you go on a day-by-day basis with whatever job comes your way. This time, it includes a famous rock musician. All enthusiastic about your next gig, you were glad to enter the prestigious private part under a guise to look for your next scoop. But what you didn't know is that your next photo is going to change your life and put you in a dangerous turmoil of murder and mystery."
