	"synopsis": "Set in the mythical world of Middle-earth, The Hobbit is an introductory tale to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  You control Bilbo Baggins as he travels from his peaceful Hobbit hole in Hobbiton into the dark and harrowing Mirkwood forest and finally to the Lonely Mountain, the home of Smaug the dragon.  During your journey, you will acquire items, knowledge, and courage to face the most terrifying of enemies.  Come face-to-face with elves, trolls, orcs, spiders, and wolves.  It's up to you to lead the quest that started it all."
