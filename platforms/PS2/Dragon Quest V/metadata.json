And when he finally becomes a man, he resolves to continue his fatherâ€™s unfinished quest -- to find the Legendary Hero.</br> This PlayStation 2 version remakes the classic RPG with new features and visual presentation. While much of the game will remind you of the original Super Famicom version, the world of \"DraQue\" and its characters and enemies are now presented here in 3D. Enemies now have lots of humorous animation patterns and frames. The battle backgrounds have great depth to them, allowing you to see mist flowing against mountains in the distance and waterfalls. Finally, the music is completely orchestrated now. "
