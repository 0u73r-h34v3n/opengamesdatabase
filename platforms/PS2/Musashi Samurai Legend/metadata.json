	"synopsis": "Musashi Samurai Legend marks the second chapter in the Musashi series. You'll play as Musashi, a young swordsman summoned to rescue a kidnapped princess. The journey, however, is a difficult one, as enemies of all types stand in your way. To survive the onslaught of foes, you must learn your opponents' techniques and use their attacks against them. Some techniques let you attack multiple enemies at once. Musashi Samurai Legend immerses you in a comic book-style adventure by combining Japanese animation with dialogue balloons."
