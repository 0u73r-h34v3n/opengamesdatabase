	"synopsis": "Inspired by Hong Kong cinema, Bujingai: The Forsaken City brings the martial arts fantasy to life. You play the role of a spell-casting, gravity-defying warrior named Lau. Set in post-apocalyptic Asia, you must battle your way through an army of fiends to rescue a fellow warrior who has been possessed by a demon. Employ sword combat and magic attacks, combined with acrobatics, gliding, and wall-walking as you fight multiple enemies. The game incorporates the best elements of Hong Kong cinema--swords, magic spells, demons, and wirework--to create an authentic action experience."
