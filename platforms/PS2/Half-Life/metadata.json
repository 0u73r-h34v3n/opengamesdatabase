	"synopsis": "Deep in the bowels of the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility, a decommissioned missile base, a top-secret experiment goes terribly wrong.  As aliens come through the walls and a military death squad shoots everything in sight, young research associate Gordon Freeman must scramble to stay alive.  Find your way through the monster-ridden areas of Black Mesa using your wits,  limited security clearance, and a variety of weapons, ranging from a crowbar and pistols to a rocket launcher and grenades.  With split-screen deathmatch and its exclusive \"Decay\" single-player and multiplayer cooperative modes, Half-Life is an action experience like no other."
