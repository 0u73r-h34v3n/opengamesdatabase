	"synopsis": "Characters within the game are Asterix, Obelix and of course the faithful hound, Dogmatix who travel Greece to find their love-stricken friend, Alafolix, who is in need of help. Asterix and his friends enter the fray in their own inimitable style, coming head to head with Brutus, his muscle-bound champion, and of course their ultimate archenemy, the mighty Julius Caesar, so there's quite some adventuring to be done as you can see."
