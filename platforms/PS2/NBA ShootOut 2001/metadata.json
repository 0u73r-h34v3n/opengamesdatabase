	"synopsis": "Fast, furious, authentic NBA action!  989 Sports' long-running b-baller makes its debut on the PlayStation 2 with live presentation unmatched on the system. The players sport thousands of motion-captured moves, and over a hundred hours of play-by-play were logged in the production. Everything in the stadium is modeled as closely as possible, from the detailed players to the real coaches on the sidelines to the people in the stands. ShootOut also brings back the Create Dunk feature, and refines the game's Touch Shooting and Passing control. As always, your choice is going to be a tough one between LIVE and ShootOut, and in the 2k1 basketball season, each has taken a shot at the game of basketball from a different angle. Check which fits your style. Authentic players, animations, and arenas make this game so realistic you'll need high tops and wrist bands to play. It's got a new and improved game engine, redesigned player controls, and a TV-style presentation that has been edited to include more camera angles, close-ups, zooms, and cut-aways. Team-specific playbooks have more than 450 plays designed with the NBA elite. With the enhancements made to the Match-Up & Deny, Read & React A.I., no artificial intelligence has ever been more savvy. This year the road to the NBA Finals begins and ends with an NBA ShootOut."
