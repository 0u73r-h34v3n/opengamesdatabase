	"synopsis": "Based on the manga of the same name, Bleach tells the story of an average high school student named Ichigo Kurasaki. Unlike his other classmates, however, Ichigo can see beyond the world of the living and into the spirit world. Not too long after he discovers this power, Ichigo is greeted by the female God of Death, Rukia; who then transfers her magical powers into him by accident and thereby connecting the two forever. From that day forward, Rukia and Ichigo set out on an adventure to seek out fallen spirits known as 'Hollows' and perform soul burials in an effort to grant them everlasting peace."
