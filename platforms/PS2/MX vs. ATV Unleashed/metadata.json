	"synopsis": "MX vs. ATV Unleashed lets you drive off-road in different vehicles, including ATVs, monster trucks, and sand rails, in an effort to conquer all-new racing challenges. You can compete in new racing events, minigames, or challenges, such as hill climbs, freestyle, gap jumps, and short-track races. Begin a career in single-player mode, or take on your friends in online multiplayer modes. A new \"rhythm racing\" mode lets you race through the game's nonlinear environments."
