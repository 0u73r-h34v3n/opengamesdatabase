	"synopsis": "Th3 Plan sees sly mastermind Robert Taylor surround himself with some of most devious and highly skills professionals with one objective in mind - steal two famous Rembrandt paintings and sell them on for a nice profit. The fact that one of the paintings is held by Taylor's old partner who sold him down the river on a previous job adds extra spice and incentive to the task."
