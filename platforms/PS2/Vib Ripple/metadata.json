	"synopsis": "The sequel to NanaOn-Sha's PlayStation 1 rhythm game, Vib Ribbon. Despite being a sequel to a rhythm game, Vib Ripple itself is not a rhythm game, instead being a hidden object game wherein each stage is a \"trampoline\" consisting of an image, with objects &mdash; called \"peta characters\" &mdash; hidden within each image that the player must reveal by jumping on them. Taking from Vib Ribbon's ability to generate new levels using music the player provides on CD, Vib Ripple instead allows the player to create new levels by importing photos from USB camera, though an already wide variety of images are included in the game itself."
