	"synopsis": "SpyHunter: Nowhere to Run takes the Spy Hunter franchise where it's never gone before: on foot. Featuring action superstar Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as government super-spy extraordinaire Alex Decker, players for the first time ever can step out of the Interceptor and straight into third-person action, utilizing The Rock's physical prowess by taking down enemies with intense melee combat moves. In Nowhere to Run, the evil NOSTRA corporation returns, this time with a plan to steal the latest government technology including the world's most sophisticated spy vehicle, the Interceptor, and it's up to Alex to stop them."
