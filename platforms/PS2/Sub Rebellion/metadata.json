	"synopsis": "The game takes place in the year 2145, fifteen years after a cataclysmic event involving massive-scale movement of the Earth's crust, resulting in two thirds of the planet being very deeply submerged underwater, as well as the exposure of a mysterious ancient civilisation that had been concealed throughout the planet. In the present, the Meluguis Empire, a cruel, oppressive and militaristic regime, is striving for world domination, and it is opposed by the Allied Forces. In a desperate effort to reverse the highly unfavourable war situation they are in, the Allied Forces develop a highly advanced submarine called the Chronos, a vessel capable of great manoeuvrability and prowess in underwater combat. This new submarine is provided to a crew of mercenaries who have volunteered to fight in service to the Alliance. "
