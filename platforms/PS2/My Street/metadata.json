	"synopsis": "Hit the streets and rule a neighborhood. My Street lets you design your own character, make friends, and defeat the town bully. As the new kid on the block, you must prove yourself in seven challenging minigames. Race remote-controlled cars, play a game of marbles, solve chemistry puzzles, or just head to the beach for some volleyball. Up to four players can compete, so grab some friends or hop online to see who the real king of the neighborhood is."
