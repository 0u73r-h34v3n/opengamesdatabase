	"synopsis": "Chou Saisoku! takes the art of customizing vehicles to extremes with incredibly tall wings, wacky paint jobs and massive body attachments which serve no purpose other than to show the madness of the driver behind the wheel. Seventeen distinctive car bodies are available at the outset of the game but additional vehicles may be unlocked for a total of 25 road hogs. Drive through 13 courses and play 10 mini-games in vehicles fit for the circus. Chou Saisoku! pokes fun at the car modification subculture and may be enjoyed from this perspective."
