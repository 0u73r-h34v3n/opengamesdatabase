	"synopsis": "Cheggers Party Quiz is a typical quiz game starring UK TV presenter Keith Chegwin. One playing round consists of eight questions (mostly about movies) and up to four players. Every time a question is asked the players are presented with four answer possibilities. If one of them thinks he knows the answer he buzzes in and selects the answer - if it is correct he receives money. Who has the most money at the end of the round wins. Between the questions Chegwin makes humorous remarks."
