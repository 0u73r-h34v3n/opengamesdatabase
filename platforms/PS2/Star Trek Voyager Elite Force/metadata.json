	"synopsis": "One blast from destruction, the U.S.S. Voyager is mysteriously transported into a null space infested with danger. As part of Voyager's elite Hazard Team, you must defend it from a host of scavenging aliens, then infiltrate a Borg cube and derelict vessels to eradicate your deadly foes. The Quake III Arena&trade; engine powers the dynamic gameplay as you fight for survival through ultra-intense single-player missions and over 30 multiplayer arenas. It's fight-person shooter action that won't quit. But, be prepared - if Voyager is destroyed, humanity won't be far behind..."
