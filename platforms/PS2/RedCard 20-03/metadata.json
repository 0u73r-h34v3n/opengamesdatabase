	"synopsis": "Redcard 20-03 shows why soccer really is a contact sport with over-the-top kicks, scores, celebrations, and tackles. In this combination of fast-paced soccer and authentic gameplay, 50 international teams compete for the Cup Championship. You can play as fantasy teams, such as Martians, Ninjas, Matadors, and Apes, or you can create your own superteam. Take your team through various modes--including Friendly, Party, World Conquest, and Finals--and increase your players' turbo power by collecting boost points."
