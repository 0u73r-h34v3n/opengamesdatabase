	"synopsis": "Capture all the speed, finesse, and action of professional hockey with NHL 2005. The game's new EA Sports Open Ice Control lets you execute offensive plays, such as a give-and-go and a breakaway pass, and you can also call for defensive double-teams. Dynasty mode has been enhanced with more interactive GM/owner relationships, including a new e-mail system. NHL 2005 also delivers all the action of the World Cup of Hockey with International Teams and venues from North America and Europe."
