	"synopsis": "FORMULA ONE 06 on is all about speed, competition and fast-paced action. If you're a novice, switch on the improved driver and racing aids to race for fun - or turn them off for a full length GRAND PRIX experience if you're a FORMULA ONE professional. FORMULA ONE 06 features the ability to Network Play between PlayStation 2 and PSP. This means players can now compete online across platforms to see who the fastest FORMULA ONE 06 racer is. In other words, if you own the PlayStation 2 version of the game and your friend owns the PSP version, you can still compete on the same circuit!"
