	"synopsis": "Wholesome farming lasts a lifetime in the coastal village of Forget-Me-Not Valley. It's a peaceful place where you cultivate friendships and raise a family among your crops and prize-winning livestock. The living isn't always easy, but it's certainly rewarding if you're willing to work hard and make thoughtful choices for your wife, child and profitable pastoral acreage."
