	"synopsis": "In the hundred years spanning the millennium (1935 - 2035), a disparate bunch of heroes and villains battle against their own challenges. Although each is unaware of the others, they all share an ageless common spirit of adventure - but unknown to them, their daring actions have attracted the attention of the TimeSplitters.   The TimeSplitters - an evil race dwelling outside of time and space. For eons they have manipulated the fate of humanity for their own malign ends - with cursed shards of crystal they have sown fear, greed and conflict throughout history. Now, roused from an ancient sleep, the TimeSplitters cross the threshold from their shadowy dimension - ripping through the fabric of time itself to confront our heroes.  Can our heroes unite against a common enemy to realize a greater destiny? Or will humanity be consigned forever to a realm ruled under the shadow of the TIMESPLITTERS?"
