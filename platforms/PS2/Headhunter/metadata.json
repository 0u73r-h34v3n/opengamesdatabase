	"synopsis": "After awakening from a coma in a sterile hospital room, Jack Wade realizes that his memories, his identity, and even his mind have all been stolen. In order to regain what he has mysteriously lost, Jack must embark on a shadowy quest that puts his headhunting skills to the test. As Jack or his accomplice Angela Stern, you must use stealth tactics or your arsenal of weapons to fight through seedy biker hangouts, gas-filled shopping malls, and futuristic laboratories."
