Using Astro's entire arsenal of iconic weapons and abilities--finger lasers, arm cannon, butt machine guns, and drill attacks--players will battle hordes of robot enemies and colossal bosses including some never-before-seen enemies across Metro City and the mysterious Surface. Using an intuitive combat system that adds depth to gameplay, players will experience classic platform action and exhilarating flight-combat levels as they use Astro's unique rocket boosters to hover, avoid enemies, and zip out of the way of danger."
