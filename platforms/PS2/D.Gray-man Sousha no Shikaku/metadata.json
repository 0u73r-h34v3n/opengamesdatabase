	"synopsis": "It is the end of the 19th century, and the Millennium Earl has spent thousands of years building an army of loyal creatures known as Akuma. There is a select group of people that stop the Earl from carrying out his plans of mass destruction; these people are the Exorcists, chosen by God through crystals referred to as Innocence, and their job is to destroy the Akuma. The story of D.Gray-man: S≈çsha no Shikaku focuses on five young exorcists who serve as members of the Black Order, operating under the Vatican and the Pope: Allen Walker from Great Britain, whose left arm can transform into an enormous claw called Crown Clown and whose cursed left eye allows him to see the souls of Akuma; Lenalee Lee from China, whose Dark Boots grant her extraordinary agility; Yu Kanda from Japan, wielding his sword, Mugen, in combat; Lavi, a cheerful young adult training to become one who records the history of the world around him, wielding a hammer called Tettsui that can modify its size; and Arystar Krory III of Romania, a \"vampire\" who sucks the blood of Akuma in order to obtain superhuman strength."
