	"synopsis": "Suzuhara Mugi is a 15-year-old on a mission. She is determined to somehow get onto the campus of Shoukei high school, one of those super elite high schools. This school is huge, very private and has tight security. Mugi is searching for her missing sister — her only remaining family — and she has been led to believe that someone or something on the campus of that school will help her in her search. Unfortunately the strict school security is preventing her from getting onto the school grounds."
