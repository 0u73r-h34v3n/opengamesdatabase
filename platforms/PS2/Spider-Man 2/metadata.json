	"synopsis": "The city is at risk and only you can save it from the evil clutches of an old enemy: the powerful Electro. He has a mysterious new device that makes his million volts of destruction even deadlier. But now Spider-Man has Insulated Armor which makes him impervious to electricity in addition to new powers such as Ice and Taser-Webbing. With your new bag of tricks you can stop Electro, Sandman and other villains' nefarious schemes to bring the city to its knees."
