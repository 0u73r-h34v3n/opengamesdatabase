Now you can become part of the college basketball experience, complete with raucous fans, loyal alumni, and a team's desire to dominate on home court. New cutscenes, play-by-play commentary, and new team chants and anthems bring you closer to the pinnacle moment of each game. Drive to the hoop, shoot a jumper, or call for a pick-and-roll. You are in control of the team's destiny."
