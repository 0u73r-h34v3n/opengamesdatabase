Choose one of 19 different characters and sleds, each one giving you different capabilities, and prepare to wage battle on one of 12 outlandish tracks, from the Swiss Alps to Atlantis. Master your snowmobile and perform any of 62 different tricks, or lure your friends into one of the special battle arenas for a duel."
