	"synopsis": "Run, jump, and fly across massive battlefields in jetpack-equipped armor as you compete with 14 other players from around the world. In Tribes: Aerial Assault, you choose between different roles and different game types, including an 11-mission single-player campaign and a Capture-the-Flag battle over the Internet. Combat takes place in the Wilderzone--the 40th century's wild frontier--in which the tribes of man clash with genetically modified Bioderm hordes. Pulverize the enemy with 10 high-tech weapons and an arsenal of grenades, mines, deployable turrets, and more."
