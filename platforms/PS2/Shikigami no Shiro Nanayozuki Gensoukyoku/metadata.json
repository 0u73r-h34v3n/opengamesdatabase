	"synopsis": "Known as Castle Shikigami in the US, Alfa Systems' Shikigami no Shiro arcade shooting series has had a strange history in the home market, with the original debuting on the Xbox and the sequel seeing its debut on the GameCube (both versions were later ported to the PS2). And now, Alpha Systems is taking the shooter and turning it into an adventure game with the all new Shikigami no Shiro: Nanayozuki Gensou Kyoku. In this new twist on the series, you play as main character Koutarou in a story centered on the characters featured in the previous two shooters. While the game's adventure sequences play out like an interactive novel as you work your way through conversation sequences, shooting stages are also included. "
