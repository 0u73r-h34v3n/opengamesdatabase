	"synopsis": "Prequel to ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]''. Is a completely new series within Sakura Taisen. Set in New York in the year 1927, Kouya no Samurai Musume tells the story of Gemini Sunrise, who also becomes the heroine for the main Sakura Taisen V title. The 16-year-old sword wielder and Texas-born cowgirl Gemini is part of the Nyuuyoukukagekidan, Hoshigumi (Star Branch) which fights a villain terrorizing America. She joins an elite group of heroines that include Shinguji Sakura of the Teikokukagekidan Hanagumi (Flower Branch) and Elaine Fontaine of the Parikagekidan Hanagumi (also Flower Branch). This high-profile PlayStation 2 release of the Sakura Taisen/Wars series features a polygonal approach to backgrounds and in-game characters (with dialog still hand-drawn against the 3D backdrops) and also stars well-known Japanese VO artist Sanae Kobayashi as the voice of Gemini."
