	"synopsis": "And 1 Streetball brings the flashy street-basketball style from the And 1 Mixtape tour to your home video game consoles. You can create a player from the ground up and take him through the trials of making the And 1 team. The game features a variety of moves inspired by real streetball players and includes venues from around the country--each with its own regional soundtrack. You can choose the size of your games, ranging from one-on-one showdowns to full five-on-five action."
