	"synopsis": "Show off your new school skiing tricks in Slopestyle mode and unlock Big Mountain mode to star in a ski movie! Then get heli-dropped onto a mountaintop, and pull insane grabs off snow-capped cottages, trains and more. Even use the Alaskan pipeline as a half-pipe. Then kick-it with your friends and watch your best runs on the big screen!"
