	"synopsis": "Makai Kingdom is a tactical role-playing game in which you play as Lord Zetta, who is hell-bent on recovering control of the netherworld. In an effort to build your army, you must imbue inanimate objects and equip them with weapons from a variety of eras, ranging from medieval to futuristic. The game combines traditional turn-based, team combat with tanks and mobile buildings that provide additional abilities to units and require special strategic consideration. Makai Kingdom's randomly generated battlefields help to give you a different experience every time you play."
