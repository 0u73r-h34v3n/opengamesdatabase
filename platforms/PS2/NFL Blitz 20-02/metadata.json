	"synopsis": "NFL Blitz 2002 is extreme-style football the way it was meant to be played. Lightning fast gameplay and action play selection screens make for non-stop action. Over-the-top animations mean you'll see bigger hits and wilder plays then you have ever dreamed of. Real teams, real players, real attitude!"
