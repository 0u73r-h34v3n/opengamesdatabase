It features new teams, a new visual layout, new game balancing, new desperation moves and spliced artwork during super attacks. Several teams have a different theme from their previous appearances, and many teams have brand new compositions written for them. Like in The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match, this game also includes a Neo Geo adaption of the original version and a gallery of the older illustrations made by Nona, but only on PS2 version. "
