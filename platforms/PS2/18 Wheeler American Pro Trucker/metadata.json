	"synopsis": "Get behind the wheel of a 60-foot-long, 20-ton, 18-wheeled truck and buckle up as you drive in locations from New York to California. 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker features arcade-style racing in four gameplay modes: arcade, parking, score attack, and versus. You'll transport cargo and race against other truck drivers--all while protecting your rig from damage. In versus mode, you can take on a friend in split-screen action on four different raceways."
