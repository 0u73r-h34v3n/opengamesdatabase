	"synopsis": "''Tales of Destiny 2'' is a direct sequel to [[Tales of Destiny]] and takes place 18 years after the exploits of Stahn and Co. You take control of Stahn and Rutee's son Kyle in his quest to become a \"real hero\". Don't be fooled by its decidedly run of the mill beginnings though. The scope of that story that ToD2 tackles is as large as Phantasia's and poses a very theological question to its players."
