Join Marco and a cast of other Metal Slug characters as they battle corrupt forces in the air, on the sea, and on land. Use power-ups, special weapons, health, and ammo to try to keep up with each game's nonstop action and challenging enemies. Of course, you can also test-drive the next generation of Metal Slug vehicles."
