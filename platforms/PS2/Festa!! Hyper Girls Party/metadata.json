	"synopsis": "The game tells the story of protagonist Takahiro Kuroda who has to live on his own after his father embarks on a business trip. Takahiro returns to his hometown of Mahorobashi, but he has no memories of the place, as his family moved away when he was just a child. While the town is quite an idyllic place, there is one major problem: there are two warring factions within it, one residing in the western part of town, the other in the eastern part. In between a boundary line has been drawn to keep the two factions from constantly fighting each other. This strict separation also applies to the local school. Will Takahiro be able to meet again with his childhood friends, whom he promised to see again, despite the troubles the barrier gives?"
