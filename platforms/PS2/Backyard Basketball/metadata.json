	"synopsis": "Kid versions of NBA stars join the Backyard Kids in Backyard Basketball.  Play as your favorite NBA players, including Yao Ming, Tim Duncan, and Kevin Garnett in pulse-pounding three-on-three basketball action.  While these NBA stars and Backyard Kids are small, they can still hit devastating jump shots, grab opening tips, nail buzzer-beating three-pointers, and perform super dunks.  With a Season Play mode, awesome power-ups, and all-new 3D environments and details, backyard basketball never looked so good."
