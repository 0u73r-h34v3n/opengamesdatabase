Take your custom golfer through the trials and tribulations of all the courses in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004, earning cash to spend on new digs and advanced equipment. Use the analog stick to shape any shot type such as the flop or punch. Go head-to-head against the computer, a friend, or an online player with PS2's network adapter. With all the top competition on some of the most famous fairways and greens ever, this is the one of the most complete golf experiences yet."
