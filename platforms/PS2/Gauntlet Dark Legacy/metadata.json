	"synopsis": "Gauntlet's hack-and-slash gameplay continues in Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. You and up to three of your friends must work as a team through eight dangerous worlds. As one of eight different characters, you'll vanquish creatures, evade traps, and search for treasure. Character-based power attacks, magic potions, new power-ups, and combination moves add to the mayhem. The game save system allows players to transfer evolving characters from their own machine to a friend's to take on the dungeon together."
