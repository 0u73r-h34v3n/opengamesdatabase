	"synopsis": "No secret handshake. No decoder ring. No stupid hat. All you need to be a member of the jet-setting Dare Devils, the most elusive and outlawed driving club in the world, is good reflexes, a gut full of courage and an artistic eye for mayhem. Wreak havoc in Rome, London, Tokyo and San Francisco, unlock fast cares and hidden courses--but if you're caught, deny everything."
