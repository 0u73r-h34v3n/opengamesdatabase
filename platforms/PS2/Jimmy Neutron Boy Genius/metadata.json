That's nothing for Jimmy Neutron, the teenage super genius whose amazing inventions often get him into heaps of trouble.  This time, it's up to you to get Jimmy out of his toughest tangle.  You'll go through six levels, including Jimmy's house, the Asteroids, Yolkus Underworld, Yolkus City, and Retroland.
