This time Dante has a new devilish partner: Lucia, a mysterious and acrobatic heroine.  Don't let Dante's handsome face lull you as he has some moves of his own, including running and jumping on walls, aerial kicking and the ability to simultaneously shoot in two directions.  Unleash your inner demon as you battle hoards of monsters in massive, hellish environments."
