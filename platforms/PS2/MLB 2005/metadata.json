	"synopsis": "MLB 2005 immerses you in the baseball experience.  This year's installment features EyeToy functionality that puts your face in the game, a new Career mode that takes gamers from Class-A ball to the Fall Classic, and a deep Franchise mode that allows players to control every aspect of running a ball club from parking prices to player contracts.  You can even join 32-team tournaments online and use the USB headset to bark out plays like a manager."
