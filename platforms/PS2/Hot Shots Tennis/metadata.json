	"synopsis": "Hot Shots Tennis is a fun, accessible sports game that's easy to pick up and play but very hard to put down. Taking the popular characters and ethos of the Everybody's Golf series, Hot Shots Tennis crams extra fun into every corner with a variety of gameplay modes for all occasions. Comprehensive training options allow you to get the very best out of your character, but it's possible to head straight onto the court and get some brilliant rallies going if that's what you want. Try the Challenge mode and take your player to the very top, or invite your friends and family to take part in an epic multiplayer match. However you play, Everybody is sure to have some fun."
