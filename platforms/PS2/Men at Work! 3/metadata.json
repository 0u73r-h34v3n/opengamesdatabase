	"synopsis": "Hidden in a forest in Europe sits an old castle that has stood there for over 1000 years and inside this castle lays a magic school. Both wizards and monster hunters in training attend this institution. In the previous installments you’re either playing as these very monster hunters and spell casters, or attending magic school like the current game. In this game you play as a son of a well established Crichton family. However, despite your potent lineage you’re aptitude has been measured to be one of the lowest possible. Regardless, you’re still admitted to the school (along with two friends who’re twin-sisters). Suddenly on the way to the school, the train you all were riding suddenly becomes derailed. It is night and monsters lurk--will the batch of new students get to the castle safe and sound?"
