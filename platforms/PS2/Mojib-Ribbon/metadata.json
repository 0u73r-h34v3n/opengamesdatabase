	"synopsis": "In Mojib-Ribbon, the player plays the part of Mojibri, a character drawn in the sumi-e style who wishes to become a famous rapper (similar to PaRappa the Rapper) and to find the truest rap of them all. In each level, Mojibri walks around a circle of clouds as rap lyrics written in kana pass underneath. The player must press up on the joystick to get Mojibri to dip his fude in the suzuri and then down to get Mojibri to write the kana as he sings it. The songs are heavily rhythm-based raps, and the player must time the application of the fude to the washi during lyrics and to the suzuri during breaks."
