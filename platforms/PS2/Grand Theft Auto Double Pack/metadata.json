The highly controversial Grand Theft Auto III gives you the freedom to go anywhere and jack anyone, putting the dark, intriguing and ruthless world of crime at your fingertips. Vice City is an entirely new game set in the '80s, preserving and adding to the free-roaming gameplay, cinematic graphics and immersive audio experience that made the Grand Theft Auto III so popular."
