	"synopsis": "Check-i-TV was an experiment created by Sony. You could connect your PS2 with an i-mode capable mobile phone through a connection cable. The program would use this connection to access i-mode services such as news, sports or user-posted content. The Check-i-TV would use this data to generate a News Broadcast using sock-puppet like characters as hosts. However, the i-mode based service went offline in 2002. "
