	"synopsis": "Kick your adrenaline into high gear as you defeat opponents with your brutal judo and kickboxing mastery. Sega's 3D fighting series evolves into a freight train of hardcore martial arts maneuvers featuring 15 competitors--some of whom can switch up their fighting style mid-fight. The new characters vying for a shot at winning the Worldwide Martial Arts Championship II Tournament are Goh, a trained assassin, and Brad, an Italian Muay Thai champion kickboxer. Once you make a name for yourself through a series of simulated arcade tournaments amid snow, rain, and sand, you'll qualify for the biggest fight of your career and show the world what you're really made of."
