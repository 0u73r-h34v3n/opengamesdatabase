	"synopsis": "Get that turtle out of your tank and take those training wheels off your hot rod--this is Rumble Racing, and it ain't for pussy-footers who're scared of the gas pedal. This is stunt-busting, air-popping, nitro-burning, rubber-rashing, engine-firing racing action on some of the wildest tracks you've ever seen. 35 tweaked-out muscle cars are in your garage, ready to guzzle some gas and run rowdy on dozens of insane tracks filled with ramps, dips, jumps, switch courses, break-away secrets, and everything else that might be there in to muck around in. Bust stunts to build your speed, and juice your caboose with blasting power-ups. You'll get giddy in the altitudes with all the air you get off this racer!"
