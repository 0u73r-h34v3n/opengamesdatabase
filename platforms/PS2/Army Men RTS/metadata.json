	"synopsis": "The Army Men series continues, this time in the real-time strategy genre. As the commander of the Green army, you must manage your soldiers and resources to find and eliminate the evil Colonel Blintz. Much like in other real-time strategy games, you can build bases, vehicles, and armies to prepare your team for war. The game features a reward-based campaign mode, a great battles mode, a special ops mode, and a tutorial mode, which helps you understand the new interface and controls."
