	"synopsis": "Join the resistance and liberate your people from the oppressive Corporation. State of Emergency plunges you into a rioting mob fighting for freedom. Use hand-to-hand combat, weapons, and anything you can find on the street to add to the chaos. The streets are littered with a variety of weapons--from park benches and soda cans to flamethrowers and rocket launchers. As you fight for the cause, don't be surprised if corporate executives, law enforcement officials, and looters fight back."
