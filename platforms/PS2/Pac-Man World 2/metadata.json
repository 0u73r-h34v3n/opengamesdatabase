In Pac-Man World 2, the Ghost Gang has picked the magical fruit from an ancient tree, thereby releasing wicked evils upon Pac-Land.  You must guide Pac-Man through six new lands with plenty of amusing surprises.  New and improved, this Pac-Man can ice skate, rollerblade, submarine dive, and solve many exciting puzzles.  With all-new moves and a zany cast of characters, your Pac-Man heroics will be pushed to its limits."
