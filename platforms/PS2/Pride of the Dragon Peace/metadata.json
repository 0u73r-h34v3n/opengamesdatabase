	"synopsis": "Pride of the Dragon Peace is a simulation RPG in which you raise a dragon and ride it into battle. Spirits throughout the world have gone mad and are causing great damage. Humans can't fight directly against spirits, so they instead turn to dragons, who use spirits as food. You play as a character who comes to a holy island to join Dragon Peace, a band of dragon riders who hope to make a move on the spirits' tower located on the island."
