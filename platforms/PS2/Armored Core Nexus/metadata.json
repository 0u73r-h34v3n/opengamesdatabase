	"synopsis": "Set in a postmodern world of destructive environments and mercenary-for-hire missions, Armored Core: Nexus delivers robot action in customizable mechanical creations, fast-paced combat, and a dynamic mission system. The two-disc package includes both the new material from Nexus and revamped missions from previous installments in the Armored Core series; plus unlockable music, movies, and artwork. Now with 400 new robot parts, you can construct a variety of AC designs. Pit your mech against more than 40 opponents in single-player, or against three of your friends through iLINK or a local network."
