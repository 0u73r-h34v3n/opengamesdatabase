	"synopsis": "All of the action and adrenaline of the Contra series comes to the PlayStation 2 with Contra: Shattered Soldier. This time, you can carry three weapons--machine gun, flamethrower, and grenade launcher--as you battle enemies either solo or cooperatively with a friend. Massive, screen-filling boss characters do everything they can to keep you from proceeding through the multiple action-packed missions, while environmental threats such as swarms of bugs, aggressive enemies, and alien encounters keep you on your toes."
