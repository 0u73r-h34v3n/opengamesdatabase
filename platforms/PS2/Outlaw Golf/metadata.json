	"synopsis": "Golf meets strippers, ex-cons, and wannabe rappers. In Outlaw Golf, you can step into the shoes of all kinds of criminals and compete in 30 tour events. With each event, you'll unlock new characters and better equipment and improve your character's skills. Challenge three of your friends in eight different games, including stroke, match, skins, best ball, casino, and more. Play like a pro and the game gets easier; play poorly and the game becomes tougher."
