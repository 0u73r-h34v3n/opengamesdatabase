	"synopsis": "It's been 20 years since the earth government and the corporations battled for supremacy. A new and mysterious entity has entered the picture, however, snapping up all the available Ravens for intense missions that only their custom-built Armored Core units can handle. As a Raven, take on 50 solo missions using revamped weapons, upgrades, and the all-new drop feature, which allows you to pick up and drop weapons in your environment. You can also pit your custom-designed ACs against your friends in two-on-two-battles."
