	"synopsis": "NHL Hitz Pro mixes a hard-hitting blend of NHL authenticity and adrenaline-style gameplay with real five-on-five NHL hockey.  While huge hits and rocket goals are common, the games still follows all NHL penalties from offsides and two-line passing to holding and cross-checking.  Choose from 23-man NHL player rosters to play in a variety of real stadiums.  Practice your skills in the retooled Hockey School mode, and then build your own dynasty in Franchise mode.  You can also play head-to-head online or set up a tournament for up to 16 teams."
