An evil world organization has been replacing world leaders with their more docile clones and it's up to you to put a stop to it.  As Bond, you'll encounter villains and allies, both new and familiar, detailed 3D environments, and spy-packed, fast-action gameplay. And don't worry, Q will provide you with all the innovative weapons, sophisticated spy-craft, and state-of-the-art gadgets that Bond fans expect."
