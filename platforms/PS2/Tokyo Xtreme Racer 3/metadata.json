	"synopsis": "In 2001, Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero gave players the opportunity to tear up the highways of Tokyo.  Now two years later, Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 adds the highways of Yokohama, Osaka and Nagoya, taking total road length to a monster 200 miles.  Choose accurately modeled cars from over 15 different licensed manufacturers such as Nissan, Toyota, GM, Ford, Merceds-Benz and Volkswagen.  Modify your car with custom parts and challenge over 600 rivals on the highways.  Are you good enough to rule the streets?"
