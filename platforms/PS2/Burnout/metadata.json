	"synopsis": "Burnout brings high-energy, arcade-style street racing to your gaming console.  Drive more than 300 realistic vehicles, and then crash them in spectacular, slow-motion fashion.  Burnout monitors your driver's heart rate: You're rewarded for near-misses and the more risks you take.   Cruise the United States and Europe on 14 awesome, traffic-filled courses, through cities and into the countryside. Instant replays allow you to relive your handiwork from multiple angles, in all of its cringe-inducing, metal-bashing glory."
