	"synopsis": "Suikoden V, like its predecessors, features unparalleled in-depth gameplay, a riveting storyline as well as the series' trademark 108 Stars of Destiny. Thrust into a time of unbalance and unrest, a dynamic drama unfolds revolving around one of the 27 True Runes, the Sun Rune. Players are tasked to explore the lands of Falena, gather allies and become stronger to ultimately bring back peace and prosperity. While on their quest through rich 3D environments, exciting new secrets of the Suikoden world will be revealed. The game features significant enhancements from all the previous installments of the series, including 6-member battle parties, multiple mini-games and the homebase system, where all of your allies gather together along with new features to create a unique gameplay experience like no other."
