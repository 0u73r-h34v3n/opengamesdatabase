	"synopsis": "With Digital Hitz Factory, you have everything you need to make a hit song. The game includes more than 16,000 instrument sounds and samples from six different musical styles, including Hip-Hop, Pop, Trance, Garage Indy, and Metal. Mix your tracks with a set of virtual decks, and record your own vocals and samples with the optional Microphone and Sampler. The game also lets you create a music video--using a library of real video clips--to play with your track."
