	"synopsis": "An epic battle rages between the Forseti and the Muspell as the oceans rise and land disappears. The Forseti compel you to help protect their remaining land by taking charge of a powerful war machine--the Battle Engine. Whether in walking or in flying mode, you have access to an array of destructive weapons to use in expansive environments. You'll command a device so powerful and advanced that your battlefield decisions will shape the direction of each engagement and, ultimately, the entire war."
