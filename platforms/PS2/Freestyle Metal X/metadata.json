	"synopsis": "Freestyle Metal X unleashes anarchy with the freedom to do what you want, when you want. Break windows, run over people, ride where you normally can't ride--and get away with it. With a variety of stunt combinations, Freestyle Metal X encourages you to push the envelope with psychotic tricks in freestyle environments full of challenges and side events. A sizable dose of insanity will help you perform stunts on the tops of buildings, jump over the Vegas Strip, or shoot yourself out  of  a cannon onto the Marina streets."
