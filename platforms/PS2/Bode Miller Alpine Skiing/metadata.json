	"synopsis": "With Bode Miller Alpine Skiing you can select a pre-existing skier or create your own. Either way, you take your skier and build them into a top Alpine athlete. Remember, though that behind every great athlete is a great manager and trainer, and this game makes no exception. The player must select a manager that suits their play style and abilities, likewise they must choose a trainer that will address the areas they need the most help in and create a training regime that will build the skills and abilities of their skier."
