	"synopsis": "In the world of NHL Hitz 20-03, hard-checking and highlight-reel action is common. This year's installment in the action-packed NHL Hitz series showcases three-on-three gameplay with players who leap, glide, check, pass, and score on defenders. New features include a deeper New Season mode, player trades, a playoff tree, and official NHL awards. The game also boasts bigger, stronger, and faster players, plus improved goalie logic, behavior, animations, and control, making it tougher to score."
