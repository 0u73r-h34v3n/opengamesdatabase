The main character of the game is Kamikura Hiroki, who lives with his younger cousin Elis. Hiroki is an art teacher while also trying to take care of Elis. Shortly thereafter, his childhood friend Kiri starts working at the school, and he meets the sickly student Tomoko, the famous \"songstress\" student Sumire, and the new substitute board chairman Saya. With the art club president Mami pestering him to be more diligent and his student Kana ramping up her offensive, Hiroki now has to juggle the feelings of these girls and the demands of his work and private life."
