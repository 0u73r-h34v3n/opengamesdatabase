	"synopsis": "AquaAqua&trade; is an addictive, fast-action, water-based puzzle game of strategy and control set in a liquid landscape. Trap water by positioning pieces as fast as they fall to form dams and lakes. Watch the weather; if it rains too much your lake will overflow and your valuable water goes down the drain. If you lose too much water it's \"game over.\""
