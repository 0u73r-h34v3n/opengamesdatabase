	"synopsis": "By 2078, earth's natural resources have been depleted. Massive CO2 emissions have occurred and there are no longer fossil fuel reserves. Because of global warming, the rise of the ocean level has made many countries disappear. Fortunately, extreme weather patterns have emerged and wind has become an endless resource with enormous speeds. Mankind has adapted and now uses the powerful wind as a source for transportation, constructing vehicles to make use of it. Additionally, The International Racing League is organized, a racing event where speed is determined by the control of wind. This is where you come in."
