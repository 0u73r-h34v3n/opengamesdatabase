	"synopsis": "WISP is a collection of experiences for the PS2 console. Human and strange. Animal and familiar. Happy and sad. Music made from people. Stories crossing each other. Japanese and English. Language and translation. Sound and shapes. Seeing stories and hearing tales. Films and pictures. Music and sound. There is gameplay on WISP, but there are no games. There is no story that holds the whole thing together, but there are stories. WISP isn't a music title but it's filled with music."
