	"synopsis": "Two men, once friends, now have their fates tied together by the death of a young maiden. Each man holds the key to a sacred glyph that when combined with the other two can open the Gateway of Chaos and lead the people to the Red Moon. You play one of the glyph keepers, Seig Warheit, a young knight that can summon and command seven different warrior legions. Through 13 levels you'll encounter hordes of enemies in real-time 3D battles."
