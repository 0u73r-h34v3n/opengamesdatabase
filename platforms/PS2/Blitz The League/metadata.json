	"synopsis": "Blitz: The League brings you more Blitz-style play, but with more content and harder hits. The League includes on-field injuries, ranging from snapping bones to bloody, career-ending hits. Now you can control the entire franchise, dealing with personnel decisions and front-office politics. New visual game modes let you view crucial game moments and moves in slow motion. In addition to traditional multiplayer, you can also play the no-holds-barred style of Blitz football online."
