In Drakengard, you must guide several characters, including Caim and his dragon, as they engage and destroy enemies on multiple battlefields. Fly high on the red dragon, and dispatch airborne opponents with powerful dragon fire and special attacks. You can even engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, while using each character's set of magic abilities and weapons."
