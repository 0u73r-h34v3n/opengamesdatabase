	"synopsis": "0.5 MPH is extremely fast-when your vehicle is only big enough to carry an ant! Jockey for first place with your favorite character from the hit motion picture Antz&trade;, using vehicles that aren't your typical garden variety.  Surf using a leaf, race on a fuse with wheels, even hop on a wasp for the antenna-raising thrill ride of your life! You may feel tiny, but practice will make you a giant among racers!"
