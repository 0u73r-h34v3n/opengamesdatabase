	"synopsis": "Objective: Use any means necessary to find and secure four stolen nuclear warheads. Track and stop the terrorist organization responsible for the theft before they can carry out their threat to national security. Dispatch as many terrorists, skinheads and enemy soldiers as necessary to complete your mission. Failure means more than just going hom in a bag, it could mean global thermonuclear holocaust. And worst of all, you won't get paid. Failure is not an option."
