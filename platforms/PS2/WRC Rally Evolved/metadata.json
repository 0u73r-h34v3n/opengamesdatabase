	"synopsis": "Taste the physical extremes of rally driving and battle your way past your opponents in grueling multi-car wheel-to-wheel racing. Prepare for the unexpected as driver and co-driver negotiate on-track dangers - evade the wreckage of rival cars, navigate through flooded stages, and dodge crumbling walls and tumbling rocks. More cars than ever before from rally's past, present and future are brought to life in realistically interactive surroundings - drive over 40 awesome vehicles through rivers, raging fires, dense smoke and debris strewn terrain."
