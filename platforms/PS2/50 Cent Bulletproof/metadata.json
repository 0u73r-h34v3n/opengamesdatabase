	"synopsis": "You can play as 50 Cent as he blasts his way through the streets of New York in 50 Cent: Bulletproof. Your path will cross those of drug and weapons dealers, informants, and a myriad of other shady characters as you and the G-Unit take on some of the largest crime families in New York. The game features many acrobatic moves for chasing enemies, dodging their attacks, and taking them out. The story was written by Terry Winter, the executive producer of The Sopranos. 50 Cent also contributes unique content to the game in the form of music tracks, freestyles, and in-game dialogue."
