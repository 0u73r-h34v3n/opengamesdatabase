	"synopsis": "In Primal Image Vol. 1, players assume the role of a fashion photographer whose goal is to take sexy snapshots of young and beautiful women. There are four CG models in all, and each of them possesses customizable behavioral types. Specialty options include the lady-poseable Producer Mode, skeletal manipulation, customizable facial expressions, and background objects that give your women environments to pose with. Primal Image is most renowned, however, for being the first game in history to use MathEngine's same bio-mechanic technology that powered the critically acclaimed Discovery Channel documentary, Walking with Dinosaurs."
