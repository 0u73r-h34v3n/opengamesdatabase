	"synopsis": "You play as Momo Samejima, a special forces agent. Your mission is to assassinate the leader of an organization that's secretly selling a potent new drug, Perorin. You'll make use of guns and grenades as you sneak into a city and face off against enemies in 3D. The chief draw of the game, even though it promises action-packed excitement, is what the special forces agent is wearing -- a mini-skirt! She tackles thugs with swift kicks in her short, short skirt. She blasts away at goons in her stocking-accessorized, ultra-short china-look dress. She may even have to sashay down guarded hallways in nothing but a bikini, with no mini-skirt on at all! "
