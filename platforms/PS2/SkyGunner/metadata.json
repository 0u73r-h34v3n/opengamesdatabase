Little do they know that the criminal genius Ventre plans to use the town's celebration aboard the luxury airship Merveilleux as an opportunity to steal the Eternal Engine for his own evil ends. Now, as one of the three Sky Gunners, you must use specialized flying machines, advanced maneuvers, and special weapons to defeat the evil forces of Ventre."
