	"synopsis": "Bomberman Kart pits its cast in a high-speed racing scenario. Spanning 16 circuits and boasting five playable characters, players must ensure their racer is the first past the post by whatever means necessary. To this end, a series of weapons can be collected, including missiles, turbo boosts and the old Bomberman favorite: cherry bombs! Bomberman Kart also includes huge array of game modes. In addition to the no-holds-barred Grand Prix, the Battle Mode encourages racers to KO their opponents in a classic 'last man standing' challenge, while the Time Attack uses a ghost rider that is updated every time a lap record is broken. Additional modes include the off-road Challenge, the Speed Race, and a multitude of sub-games in the Random Challenge section. "
