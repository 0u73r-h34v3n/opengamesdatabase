Players choose one of eight modern-era countries before waging war in a series of 25 missions, each offering multiple objectives and win conditions. The game includes Free Play, Mission, and Campaign modes, over 400 units and 100 maps in total, and multiple tutorials to help new generals learn the play mechanics."
