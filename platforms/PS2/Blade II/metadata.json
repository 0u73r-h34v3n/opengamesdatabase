In Blade II, you are a vampire hunter who possesses all the strengths of a vampire, and none of its weaknesses. Skilled in martial arts, guns, and swordplay, you must protect humans from the hungering darkness. Keep the evil forces at bay with your 360-degree combat system and unstoppable rage powers. High-tech weaponry, destructive rage abilities, and over-the-top finishing moves turn every enemy encounter into an action-packed bloodbath."
