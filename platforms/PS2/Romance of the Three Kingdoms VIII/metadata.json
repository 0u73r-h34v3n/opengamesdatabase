	"synopsis": "In Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII, you can choose to bring an end to chaos or fuel personal ambitions. Play up to eight characters in a single game--from a loyal officer who helps his lord to a rogue general forging his own path to fortune and glory. While depicting historically significant relationships--such as the brotherhood between Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei--the game allows you to create new bonds between characters. Now, nearly all forces of second-century China collide on the battlefield."
