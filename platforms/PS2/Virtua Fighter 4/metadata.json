	"synopsis": "The fourth world fighting tournament begins with all-new simulated martial arts moves and styles. In Virtua Fighter 4, you can play as one of 13 different combatants--11 classic Virtua Fighter characters along with two new characters--Lei Fei, a shaolin monk, and Vanessa Lewis, a vale tudo practitioner. Each character has their own fighting style, all of which are based on real martial arts, including jeet kune do, aiki ju-jitsu, and pancratium. The Training mode is a good place to learn the game and perfect your moves, while Survival mode tests your staying power."
