Race vehicles from manufacturers, including Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Subaru, and Mitsubishi, against up to eight drivers online or up to two drivers in split-screen mode. You'll tear past spectators, maneuver your way through tight mountain passes, and round each corner of the race track in your dream car at lightning speeds."
