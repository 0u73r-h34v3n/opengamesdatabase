	"synopsis": "Based on the TV show, MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch pits famous personalities against each other in bloody bouts. Each of the 15 characters has their own special moves and reflects the damage taken during fights with bruises, blood, dents, and deformities. You can also create your own celebrity and test his or her skills in the arena spotlight. Original show hosts Nick Diamond and Johnny Gomez provide color commentary while referee Mills Lane calls the shots."
