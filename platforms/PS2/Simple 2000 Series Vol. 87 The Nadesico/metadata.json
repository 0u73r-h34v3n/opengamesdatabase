You can also acquire Soul orbs which act as a 'currency' of sorts to allow acquiring additional moves for your character including a major special attack (at a high fee, of course); there's also the option of upgrading character attributes such as Health, Strength, Speed, etc. <br/>There are about ten levels in story mode and about 100 in mission mode - the latter of which is unlockable as you play through the game."
