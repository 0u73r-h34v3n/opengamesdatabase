	"synopsis": "Cats lived peacefully on their large tree until the emperor Shun, king of the gorillas, invaded their village. Kay, a young cat trained in martial arts, steps up to the challenges of protecting his village and finding his father. As Kay, you'll experience close-combat fighting while improving your fighting skills, acquiring new weapons and powers, and discovering secrets. The worlds, which include woods, swamps, caves, and more, re-create the look and feel of classic martial arts movies."
