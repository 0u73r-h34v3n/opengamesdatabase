	"synopsis": "Beatmania IIDX11: IIDXRED (with RED standing for \"Revolutionary Energetic Diversification\") is the 11th game in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania_IIDX Beatmania IIDX] series of music video games. It was released in arcades by [[Konami]] in 2004. The game features many new songs, some of which are unlocked over Konami's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Amusement e-Amusement] platform. As suggested by the title, IIDXRED's color scheme is red and black, and was one of the first versions to not use the word \"style\" to denote its version and have a legitimate theme (a pattern that would continue on later versions)."
