	"synopsis": "Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Vol. 1 includes four classic Fatal Fury games: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury:_King_of_Fighters Fatal Fury], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_2 Fatal Fury 2], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_Special Fatal Fury Special] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_3:_Road_to_the_Final_Victory Fatal Fury 3: Road to The Final Victory]. The Fatal Fury series was SNK's first ongoing fighting-game franchise, and many beloved SNK characters and locations made their first appearances in Fatal Fury. Fatal Fury was also the first fighting game to feature a two-plane system, allowing characters to dodge out of harm's way when confronted with a challenger's attacks."
