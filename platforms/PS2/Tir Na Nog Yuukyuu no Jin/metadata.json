	"synopsis": "Tir Na Nog: Yuukyuu no Jin is a RPG based on Celtic myths. It comes with what is described as a \"scenario generation function\" that changes the way you play each time. Tir Na Nog offers 8 different main stories each with multiple endings. The battle is done through an auto-battle feature that requires you organize, strategize, and properly equip characters. Characters have their own personalities and abilities. There are over 300 different events that can happen throughout the game and it depends largely on how you handle each one. It features a Pictoral Book where you can collect and view over 300 events. As a heroic spirit, the player goes on adventures with up to 5 parties, improves ability in battle, gains items, grows in affection with friends, and races with various parties become companions such as elves and dwarfs as well as over 120 tribes.
