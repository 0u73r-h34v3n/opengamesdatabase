	"synopsis": "The president of the United States of America has been assassinated and you are the prime suspect.  In XIII, you must unravel a conspiracy that left your memory erased, the President dead, and a bullet wound in your head.  Evade assailants eager to end your life or use them as human shields.  Select from a deadly arsenal of weapons including silent crossbows, furious automatic weapons, and ashtrays.  Face off against other players in multiplayer modes such as Barfight or go co-op in Cover Me mode.  Uncover both your shadowy past and America's darkest corridors of power."
