	"synopsis": "Twenty fighters from the Tekken series return in Tekken Tag Tournament. The game offers two-on-two tag-team matches for up to four players, but it also includes single-player one-on-one, time attack, and survival modes. You can even play Tekken Bowling, a minigame in which the fighters use only a ball to strike down Heihachi-headed pins. Although based on the arcade game, the console version of Tekken Tag Tournament features revamped graphics, more moves, and new modes."
