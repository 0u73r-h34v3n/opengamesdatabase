	"synopsis": "Thrillville: Off the Rails \"lifts\" up the family-friendly mix of gameplay from [[Thrillville]] with some of the most wildly creative roller-coaster concepts ever imagined, as well as new ways to communicate with park guests and a vast array of carnival games. Off the Rails lives up to its name with 20 death-defying rides so outrageous, they inspire the same word from every park visitor who sees them: \"WHOA!\" Build these incredible \"WHOA Coasters\" to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning rings of fire, and much, much more."
