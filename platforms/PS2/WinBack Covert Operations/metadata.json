	"synopsis": "The first blast wiped out your space center, and in just three hours, the high-tech weapons satellite is going to strike again--unless you stop it. You are Jean-Luc Couger, a special operative for the government's Strategic Covert Actions Team. As the terrorists count down to a second attack, you must duck, sneak, and crawl through enemy-infested environments. And when the situation calls for a more aggressive approach, you'll have a wide variety of weapons to choose from."
