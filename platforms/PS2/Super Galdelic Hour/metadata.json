	"synopsis": "Super Galdelic Hour: Four innocent animals morph into exuberant girls when the Super Galdelic Hour runs. The girls engage in various sports which enhance their natural wiggles and jiggles; jumping rope isn't exactly something the modest will want to engage in when body parts are already hanging loose. The other events include big glove boxing, tree chopping, a pie throwing contest, butt bumping sumo attack, and Kuru Kuru Bout which takes place on two separate pedestals."
