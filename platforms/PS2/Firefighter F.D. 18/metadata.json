As a firefighter, you'll break down doors with axes, use high-powered fire hoses to smother flames, and avoid collapsing floors while looking for trapped civilians. In addition to blazing fires, you must overcome obstacles such as smoke, gas, explosive chemicals, and environmental dangers that lurk throughout the city. Firefighter F.D.18 puts you in the heat of the action as you unravel the mystery of random eruptions of fire throughout a sprawling metropolis."
