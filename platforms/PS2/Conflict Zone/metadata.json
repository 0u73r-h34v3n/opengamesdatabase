	"synopsis": "Enter the world of modern warfare, where the manipulation of media and civilians leads to military victory. As the commander of peacekeeping armies, you must build a campaign using strategy and spin control. Rescue hostages with news cameras rolling and gain public support to upgrade your units; harm innocents, and watch your popularity and power plummet. In Conflict Zone, media manipulation, brainwashing, and human shields are just as important as superior combat skills."
