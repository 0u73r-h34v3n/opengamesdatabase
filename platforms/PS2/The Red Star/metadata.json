	"synopsis": "The Red Star is set around three main characters. It tells the tale of an alternate URRS where massive technology and futuristic weapons are wielded by its army, The Red Fleet. Your journey begins as Maya Antares, the sorceress-general for The Red Fleet, searches for her husband, Marcus, who was lost in battle. Each of the game's three characters offers different game experiences. During cooperative play the characters can interact with each other and perform special attacks. The game is a mix of different types of games. It has been described as a fighting, action and shooter game. RPG elements are also apparent as players have the option of upgrading certain attributes of a character depending on how well levels are completed."
