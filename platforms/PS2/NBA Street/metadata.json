	"synopsis": "NBA stars take their skills to the streets--but out here, style and attitude win ball games. NBA Street lets you play in three-on-three basketball games that encourage flashy dunks, blocks, passes, and dribbles. The more you showboat, the greater your momentum meter becomes, thus boosting your team with a special game-breaking move. From East to West Coast, you'll compete against NBA stars, NBA legends, and street hoopsters while gaining points to unlock even more players."
