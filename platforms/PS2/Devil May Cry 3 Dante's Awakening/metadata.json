	"synopsis": "Devil May Cry 3 reintroduces the mysterious hero, Dante, in a new game featuring a new storyline, more weapons, and intense action. Set before the original Devil May Cry, the game follows Dante's journey as he battles his evil twin brother in a final confrontation. Along the way, you'll encounter both formidable foes and unusual characters. When attacking, you can choose to use short-range, long-range, defensive, or evasive play styles. Each system has its own range of gameplay features, and you can choose to power up your favorite style for increased special attack abilities."
