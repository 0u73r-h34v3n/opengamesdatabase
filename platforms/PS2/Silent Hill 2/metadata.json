	"synopsis": "In the sequel to Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland, whose life is shattered when his young wife Mary suffers a tragic death.  Three years later, a mysterious letter arrives from Mary, beckoning him to return to their sanctuary of memories, the dark realm of Silent Hill.  You must guide James through all-new environments and creepy new areas closed off in the original game.  Real-time weather effects, fog, morphing, and shadows set the stage for heart-stopping frights. Be brave as you journey to uncover the truth."
