	"synopsis": "Set before the original Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition follows Dante's journey as he battles his evil twin brother in a final confrontation. Along the way, you'll encounter both formidable foes and unusual characters. When attacking, you can choose to use short-range, long-range, defensive, or evasive play styles. Each system has its own set of gameplay features, and you can choose to power up your favorite style for increased special attack abilities. The Special Edition adds the ability to play as Dante's nemesis Virgil and a survival game mode."
