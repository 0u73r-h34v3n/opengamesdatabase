	"synopsis": "Freaky Flyers takes you into the air for fast-and-furious racing with an interesting cast of animated characters. You'll either play as or encounter more than a dozen characters including an American hero, a female bandit from south of the border, and a mellow ambassador of tropical paradise. Explore, adventure, and dogfight in the skies over Danger Island, Haunted Transylvania, and Roaring Chicago. Pirates, haunted castles, and mob bosses all lie ahead of you--are you skilled enough to overcome these dangers?"
