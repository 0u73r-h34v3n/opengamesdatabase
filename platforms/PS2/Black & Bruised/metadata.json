Nineteen outrageous characters fight their way through grueling slugfests to win the pot or settle a score. You'll play through their intertwining stories as they battle each other in 21 different arenas. During each match, you can earn power-ups such as Armor, AutoSlip, Vamp, or Fire Damage to give your fighter a competitive advantage over your opponent."
