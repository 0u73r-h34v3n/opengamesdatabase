	"synopsis": "Darkness reigns. Sinister creatures stalk the innocent. King Argus III lies helpless and unconscious, dying from the assassination attempt that has left him poisoned and weak. Malazak, the revenge-driven son of the Wyrm-Father, awaits King Argus's death so he can divide the kingdom between himself, a demon, and a dark minotaur. Only one possesses the power to set things right. You must find the DragonBone Staff."
