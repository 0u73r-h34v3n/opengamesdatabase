Challenged by hordes of raiders, ghouls, mutants and other radioactive nightmares the players use a combination of intense combat strategies including melee/ranged combat to fulfill their daunting task of defeating the threats in hopes of restoring humanity in a nearly unlivable universe.  Welcome to the wasteland."
