By stepping into the roles of each of the main characters--Li Mu Bai, Yu Shu Lien, Jen, and \"Dark Cloud\" Lo--you can unleash a variety of fighting techniques, weapons, stunts, and moves against brutally gifted enemies.  Characters improve in skill throughout the game, learn new moves, and earn bonuses and rewards as they master the art of Wudan-style fighting."
