	"synopsis": "A host of diverse teams from across the globe unite on the green for intense three-on-three matches of soccer. Not your ordinary soccer game, Sega Soccer Slam involves violent tackles, killer kicks, and spotlight maneuvers. In Quest mode, you can take any team through a series of matches, while unlocking secret stadium locations and gaining access to hidden power-ups. Alternative gameplay options include Arcade mode, Challenge mode, and a round-robin Tourney mode with multiplayer action for up to six players."
