With the F-14, F-18, and F-22 under your control, you must embark on dangerous low-level missions throughout hazardous canyons and across vast cityscapes. Eliminate ground or air targets in Southeast Asia, Gulf States, Arctic Circle, and Miramar Base. The game offers intense missions and a replay mode that lets you review each one through different camera angles."
