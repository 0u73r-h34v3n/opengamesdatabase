While wielding the burden of an evil being, Ari and his friends must journey across a wonderfully animated, whimsical world. You'll discover new environments, solve puzzles, and battle more than 100 enemies. Engage in action-packed battle sequences where allies and enemies fight simultaneously and in real-time.
