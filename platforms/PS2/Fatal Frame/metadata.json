	"synopsis": "Based on a true story, Fatal Frame recounts Miku's investigation for her brother Mafuyu, who has been missing for two weeks. Her latest clue leads her to the abandoned Himuro mansion, a place that local townsfolk fear. Gifted with a supernatural sixth sense, you'll guide Miku as she explores the areas in the mansion where Mafuyu was last seen investigating the disappearance of three other people. Armed with only a camera, you must discover the connection between mysterious disappearances, restless spirits, and ritual sacrifices."
