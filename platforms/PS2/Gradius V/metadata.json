	"synopsis": "Based on the 1980s arcade and console game, Gradius V features the classic side-scrolling shooting gameplay with all-new elements, including new option controls, levels, weapons, and missions. You'll have access to a variety of upgradable power-ups that help you fight through seven expansive levels. For the first time in the Gradius series, you can play simultaneously with a friend and then check the Internet Ranking System to see if you've made the high-score list."
