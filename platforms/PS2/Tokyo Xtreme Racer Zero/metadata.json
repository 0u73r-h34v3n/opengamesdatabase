	"synopsis": "No grandstands, no checkered flag--Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero is just pure head-to-head competition. Race through the streets of Tokyo at up to 200 miles an hour and challenge other racers to winner-take-all competitions. As you gain victories, you can customize your car with over 125 parts, new paint jobs, and stickers. You'll need a finely tuned machine, plus quick reflexes, and nerves of steel if you want to become Emperor of the Highway."
