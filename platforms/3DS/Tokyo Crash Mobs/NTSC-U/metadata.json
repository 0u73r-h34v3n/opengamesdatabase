	"synopsis": "All Grace and Savannah want is to make it in Tokyo, but what’s with all the scenesters, bomb balls, flower displays, and ninjas getting in their way?! You’ll need lightning-fast reflexes and an eye for strategy to succeed in this fast-paced puzzle game, where live-action video blends seamlessly with wacky digital graphics. Throw and roll hapless bystanders into lines of people, trying to group three or more who wear the same color together so that they’ll form a clique and disappear. Form cliques and eliminate the lines you’re facing as fast as you can to progress through the game’s many stages. With two different play modes—Story Mode and Challenge Mode—this game’s got you covered whether you’re looking for quick gaming sessions or longer endurance challenges."
