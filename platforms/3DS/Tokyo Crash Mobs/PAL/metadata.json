	"synopsis": "Queues: an annoying fact of life or, as in Tokyo Crash Mobs, the inspiration for a new type of puzzle game! This wacky action puzzler lets you indulge your queue-busting desires by throwing or rolling people into queues; match three of the same colour together and they disappear - moving you a step closer to the front. Play in Story Mode as would-be bargain hunters Grace and Savannah, or Team Battle using the Nintendo 3DS gyro sensor to fend off shopaholic ninjas and UFOs!"
