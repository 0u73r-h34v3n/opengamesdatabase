	"synopsis": "Azure Striker GUNVOLT is a 2D action/platforming game in the style of the Japanese classics of yesteryear. Great controls, crisp graphics, unique play mechanics, epic boss battles â€” it's all here, and better than you remember! * Obliterate foes with the power of lightning! Tag enemies with your weapon, then shock them into oblivion with Gunvolt's lethal \"Flashfield\" technique! Advanced players can try for bonuses and higher scores by defeating two or more enemies at once. * Gain power from Lumen's anthem! Lumen, aka the Muse, has the power to revive Gunvolt if he falls in battle. And if you rack up enough Kudos by defeating enemies without taking damage, she'll sing for you during play, giving you an added boost! * Defeat the Sumeragi Seven! Powerful bosses and an intriguing tale await. Will Gunvolt be able to put a stop to the Sumeragi Group's ambitions before it's too late? The time to strike is now!"
