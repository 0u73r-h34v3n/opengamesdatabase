They soon learn that they, along with seven others, are about to play a game of life and death—The Nonary Game: Ambidex Edition. Each participant is equipped with a bracelet that will kill them if they break the rules. Controlled by a mysterious rabbit named Zero III, the Nonary Game will force its players to decide who to trust and who to betray. If they can solve a series of fiendishly difficult puzzles, then perhaps they can uncover the mystery behind Zero III.
