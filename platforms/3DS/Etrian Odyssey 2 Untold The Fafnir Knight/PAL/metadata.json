Delve into the Yggdrasil Labyrinth, explore its many twists and turns, and fight a variety of strange monsters in turn-based combat. As you trample through the dungeon, confront large and powerful beasts visible outside of battle, then muster the courage to take on these potent adversaries – or evade them completely. Be careful – they move with each step you take, so watch their movements closely."
