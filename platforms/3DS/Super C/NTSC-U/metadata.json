	"synopsis": "Original Release Date: December 1988 In this action-packed sequel to the popular Contra, players have little time to think. Experience run-and-gun gameplay at its best as you take control of Mad Dog or Scorpion and once again battle the forces of Red Falcon. Stages feature a combination of perspectives (side scrolling, top down, etc.) and intense battles against huge bosses. Use a variety of powerful weapons and tap into your killer instinct to survive the deadly waves of enemies. Because if your trigger finger lacks stamina, then Earth will lack a future!"
