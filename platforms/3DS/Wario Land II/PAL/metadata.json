Help Wario recover his riches in this classic, comical platformer. Wario can't be hurt, but certain enemy attacks will have weird effects on his body; transforming him into new guises such as flaming Hot Wario or Zombie Wario â€“ each with unique abilities. Solve puzzles, play mini-games, and look for hidden exits that lead to more treasure and even different game endings."
