The first in the classic series, Gradius introduced the now familiar system of collecting capsules to boost your ship's abilities; missiles, increased speed, laser beam, force field and more. You must use your skills as a pilot and choose your weapons wisely, as you face off against waves of enemies and enormous bosses. Never forget: shoot the core!"
