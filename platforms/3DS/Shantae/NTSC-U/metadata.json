When the nefarious lady-pirate, Risky Boots catches wind of the treasure that was recently unearthed in the village, she launches an attack. To get Scuttle out of trouble, it's up to Shantae to prove that she's the rightful “Guardian Genie” to the best of her dancing, buying and hair-whipping abilities. Learn “Dance Magic” to get new attacks, and battle your way through over 50 locations and Mini-Games!"
