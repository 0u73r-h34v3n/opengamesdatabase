	"synopsis": "Let's go back a few years. OK... say 30, to the old days, when everything looked really simple and the rest was left to your imagination. The main aim in the 10 in 1: Arcade collection is to survive the classic challenge and achieve the highest score possible. Retro arts, particle effects and wonderful 8-bit music will also bring back fond memories of youth for some, and for those too young to remember, it will be a great showcase of the old times!"
