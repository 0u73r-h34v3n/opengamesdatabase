Galaga became an instant classic with its innovative fighter combination system and varied enemy attack patterns. Control your fighter and shoot down the waves of invading aliens; and win bonuses in challenging stages by not missing a single enemy. If your fighter gets captured by an enemy, free it from the tractor beam and combine with it to form a dual fighter with twice the firepower!"
