This vast undersea kingdom is filled with both dangerous and harmless denizens. Its fearful inhabitants are led by a reluctant fish who has no answer to the impending disasters. Their fate rests with you, Ikachan. You must help them find a way out before it's too late. Use whatever tools you can and try to escape. Swim, Ikachan, swim!"
