Steev and the rest of the Squids are in danger! An infectious black ooze is corrupting their world. The band of unlikely heroes need to fight back to save their kingdoms! Squids Odyssey is not just about gorgeous cartoon art, jaunty music and humorous storytelling, the battles provide a deep challenge as strategy and skill are required to use the environment, the Squids’ strengths and enemies’ weaknesses to victory!"
