The only things that can remove these sluggish shoes and restore Sonic's speed are the Chaos Emeralds hidden within Dr. Eggmanâ€™s Super Labyrinth. Spin through four labyrinth zones, each containing three regular stages and a Boss stage. Seek out square warp gates to find special items, and earn extra lives by grabbing 100 rings in Bonus stages. Find the Chaos Emeralds before time runs out!"
