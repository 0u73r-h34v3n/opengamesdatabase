The turnip mortar will do maximum splash damage. These crafty cottontails come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them can even fly, so you'll need every weapon in your armory to deal with this barbarous band of bitter bunnies. How they became evil, where they came from and who taught them to fly remains a mystery. But there's no time to ponder these rabbit riddles, just grab your favorite weapon and...Blast 'Em Bunnies! Shoot coins to collect them and then spend them on new weapons, upgrades, ammo types or boost your health! Jump into neat new arenas or customize the bunnies look with DLC arena and skin packs."
