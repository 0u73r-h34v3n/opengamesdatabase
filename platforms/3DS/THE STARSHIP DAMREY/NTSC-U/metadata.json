You awaken to discover that you are trapped in a Cold Sleep capsule aboard the titular Starship Damrey, with no memory of who you are or how you got there. With no tutorials, explanations, or hints provided, the game was created with the intent that self-discovery and experimentation be an integral part of the experience. An inconcievable truth awaits those willing to discover it. Do you dare to hope? Or will despair claim the final shreds of your mind? Discover the mystery of the Starship Damrey to find out for yourself."
