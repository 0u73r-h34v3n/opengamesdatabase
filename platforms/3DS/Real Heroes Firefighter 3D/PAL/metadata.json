Aim jets of water, swing axes and prise open doors. Adding to the already intense drama is an impressive cast of voice actors. Become that rarest of commodities - a real hero! In this first-person fire & rescue action game players will enter the soot-stained boots of an everyday hero as a newly graduated academy cadet getting their start in a big city fire station. Players must use the tools of the trade like the axe, hose and saw to battle raging blazes, tackle explosive environments and rescue survivors."
