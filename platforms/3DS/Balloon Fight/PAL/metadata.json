	"synopsis": "Go up, up and away with this NES™ classic from the 1980s. In Balloon Fight you have one simple mission: pop or be popped! Burst enemies' balloons from above, and hit them again before they have time to re-inflate. Danger comes from the sky or sea, too; watch out for lightning strikes and a very hungry fish. Balloon Fight also features a two-player mode with cooperative and competitive play, plus a survival mode called Balloon Trip - which may be familiar to fans of Nintendo Land™!"
