Drag and match Orbs, or chain together combos to deal massive blows to your enemies. Choose between a team lead by Mario™ or Luigi™ and take it to the Koopa menace. The full version of the Puzzle & Dragons Z + Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros.™ Edition game gives you two complete games on one cartridge. In Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition, continue to use the power of the Orbs as you travel to different worlds. Assemble your own team of Mushroom Kingdom baddies, like Goombas or Koopa Troopas, and recruit much-loved Mario™ characters, including Toad™ and Yoshi™! Or in Puzzle & Dragons Z, battle the 5 powerful Sky Dragons to rebuild the world and customize your team with a plethora of monsters. Allies gained in both games have the chance to evolve into more advanced forms and learn powerful new skills."
