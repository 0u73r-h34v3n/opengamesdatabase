	"synopsis": "Mario Bros. is a treasure trove of gaming history. The follow-up to the hit Donkey Kongâ„¢, it was not only the first time our hero was known as Mario, it also introduced his brother Luigi, green pipes, coins and even more now-familiar elements of the Mario series. The gameplay is simple yet challenging: eliminate all the enemies in each level for a big score. However, Mario cannot jump on enemies from above so must hit them from below and finish them off with a kick. Add a second player as Luigi for even more fun!"
