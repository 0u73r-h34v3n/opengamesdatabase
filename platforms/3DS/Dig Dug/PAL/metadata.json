Defeat enemies by inflating them with air or by dropping rocks on them from above. Earn bonus points by collecting fruit or defeating deep-dwelling foes. This classic game blends old-school arcade action with strategy; try to lure multiple enemies into position and satisfyingly squash them with a single rock!"
