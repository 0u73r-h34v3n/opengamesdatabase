	"synopsis": "When an accident scatters stickers across the land, Mario™ sets off on an adventure to repair a torn world. Searching Forests, Deserts and Mountains, Mario collects stickers to solve puzzles and battle monsters. In a first for the series, there are no experience points, so finding power-ups to improve Mario’s abilities is more important than ever. Mixing sticker-based gameplay elements with the traditional action-battle system of the Paper Mario™ series delivers a new twist on a classic franchise. Flatten-out characters, roll out towns, and walk through living, breathing dioramas in a brand-new Paper Mario adventure on the Nintendo 3DS™ system!"
