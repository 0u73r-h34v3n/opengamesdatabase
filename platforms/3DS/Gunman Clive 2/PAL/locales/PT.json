	"synopsis": "Gunman Clive returns in an all new adventure. Now in Colour! After rescuing Ms Johnson, Gunman Clive returns to again find the town under attack by bandits. To stop them once and for all he must chase after their leader; an adventure that takes him all the way around the world, facing bigger and deadlier enemies than ever before. Gunman Clive 2 retains the same classic gameplay formula, but dials the action up a notch further, with improved and more colourful graphics, more dynamic levels and richer, more diverse environments, bigger bosses and tons of new enemies."
