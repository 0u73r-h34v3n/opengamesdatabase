One or two players must demolish every obstacle in each enemy-infested level, while working out the most destructive route through the networks of ladders and scaffolds. Wrecking Crew also includes a mode for designing your own levels. This Virtual Console™ version also features the ability to save your creations, which was not possible in the NES original."
