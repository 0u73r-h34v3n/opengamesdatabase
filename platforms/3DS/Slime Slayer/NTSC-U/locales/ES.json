	"synopsis": "Have you ever wished that certain old school 8-Bit games could pop to life into a 3D world? Thus is the inspiration for Slime Slayer! Slime Slayer is a Pixel Prime FPS, 8-Bit 3D, procedurally generated, rougelike dungeon crawler. Dare to sing along with the trailer song: Slime Slayer. Slime Sla-a-a-a-yer! First you find the sword, Then you slay the slime, Then you slay more slime! When you slay - the last slime, Find the exit - before you're out of time! Or you're finished. Slime Sla-a-a-a-yer!!!"
