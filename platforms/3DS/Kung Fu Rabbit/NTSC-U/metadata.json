They'll soon regret it! Use your agility and combat skills to save your disciples! Jump from roof to roof, slide gracefully along walls, sneak up on your enemies, and rip them them to shreds! Detailed graphics, humour, hours of gameplay and intuitive controls. Each of the 70 levels requires logic, precision, agility and lots of sabre rattling. The game also has lots of trophies to win, babies to save, carrots to eat, and a Universal Evil to expunge. - 80 levels in normal and hard mode (dozen hours of play!) - 15 unlockable items to customize your rabbit. - Text in English"
