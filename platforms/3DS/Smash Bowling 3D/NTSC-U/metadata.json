Up to four players can participate in pass around multiplayer mode, while practice mode allows would-be bowlers to set their own pin layouts - anything from a single pin needed for a spare to the infamous 7-10 split. Enjoy varied-angle replays of your best shots. Earn all 18 trophies as you strive for bowling perfection. Unlock great bowling ball designs and vibrant bowling alleys. Your career statistics are tracked, including best game, recent average, total points, and number of strikes among others."
