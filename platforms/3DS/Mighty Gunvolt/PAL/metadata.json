A loving nod to the retro sidescrollers of the late '80s, MIGHTY GUNVOLT offers simple controls, cute & colorful graphics, and a surprising amount of complexity and fun. Play as one of three characters: Gunvolt, the star of Azure Striker GUNVOLT, Ekoro, an angel from Japan's Gal*Gun series, or Beck, the hero of Mighty No. 9. Each character possesses unique skills that will allow players to keep challenging each stage in new and creative ways!"
