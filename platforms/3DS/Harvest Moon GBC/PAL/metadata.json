This classic simulation lets you get hands-on with every aspect of farm life: from sowing crops to raising animals. The harder you work, the bigger and better your farm will become. You can also visit the town to buy supplies; from food and drink to keep up your strength, to labour-saving tools for making life easier. Short on time? Let the Harvest Sprites tend to your farm while your Nintendo 3DS™ system is switched off!"
