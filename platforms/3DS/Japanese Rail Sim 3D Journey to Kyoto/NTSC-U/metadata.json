	"synopsis": "Journey to Kyoto is part of the popular Japanese Rail Sim 3D series and features driving over the complete line from the first station to the last! The game is set on the Eizan Electric Railway which travels around the ancient capital of Kyoto. The scenery from the driver’s point of view is reproduced in intense 3D images. You will enjoy driving a 900-type “Kirara” on your railway journey from the suburban Demachiyanagi Station to the mountainous Kurama Station. You will pass through the popular tourist spot the “Momiji no Tonneru (tunnel)” where the branches of maple trees overlap to create a tunnel of bright autumn colors. Both a ‘Day Mode’ and a ‘Night Mode’ are available, so you can enjoy the various atmospheres as you drive. By getting high scores in the game, you can see information about the many tourist spots along the track such as the Shimogamo-jinja Shrine and the Kifune-jinja Shrine, and feel like you’re actually visiting Kyoto."
