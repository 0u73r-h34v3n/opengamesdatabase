The continent of Vainqueur is plagued with the spreading desertification, laying the land to waste by turning it slowly into sand. Tensions rise, and war breaks out for the remaining fertile land. Stocke, a Special Intelligence agent of Alistel, is sent on a special mission when he discovers the powers of the relic, the White Chronicle. With his new-found abilities, Stocke will need to right the wrongs of the past in order to prevent the total annihilation of the world. In this version, a new, mysterious character named Nemesia teaches him about the world's history and unlocks a third timeline to explore the ripple effect of some of his actions with episodic \"what-if\" scenarios. With redesigned character art, new character voice-overs, music from the original composer Yoko Shimomura, and additional difficulty settings, Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology will enhance the experience in this fresh take of a beloved story. This title also features both the classic original and an exhilarating new story through Perfect and Append modes. Append mode allows you to beat the original game before having the option to start a New Game+ with the added content, while Perfect mode lets you play through the game with the inclusion of the new content from the beginning.
