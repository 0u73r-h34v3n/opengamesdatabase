	"synopsis": "The screen flickers to life in the dead of night... An intermittent beep-beep-beep pulses out of the speaker... Words on the screen spell out an urgent message from across the waves: \"ENEMY FLEET APPROACHING STOP DEPLOY IN ATTACK FORMATION STOP\" There's no time to lose. Steel your nerves and take command of a fleet of warships and engage an enemy fleet in battle, trying to sink their ships. Battles can be either fought using radar in Game A or controlling a submarine in Game B. This version of the game does not have multiplayer functionality."
