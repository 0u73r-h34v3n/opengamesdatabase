	"synopsis": "Kirbyâ€™s Dream Course puts a new spin on golf, with Kirby as the ball and enemies as obstacles! Conquer eight different courses packed with water, spikes, conveyor belts and trampolines. Roll Kirby to take out enemies, and then head for the hole that appears. Adjust the angle of movement, add spin and power, and also copy the powers of enemies; such as using a parasol to float, ice to freeze water or fire to burn bad guys! This is the US version of the game."
