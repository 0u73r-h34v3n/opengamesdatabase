Donkey Kong Country breathed new life into the character of Donkey Kong™, and introduced gamers to Diddy Kong™, Cranky Kong™ and bad guys the Kremlings. Join DK and Diddy on a quest to recover their stolen banana hoard. Traverse more than 30 challenging levels, take a ride on animal buddies and survive the madcap mine cart sequences. You'd be bananas not to play Donkey Kong Country!"
