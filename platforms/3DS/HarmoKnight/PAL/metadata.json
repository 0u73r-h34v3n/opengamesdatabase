	"synopsis": "HarmoKnight combines side-scrolling platforming with rhythm-action gameplay to create an exciting and colourful experience. Each stage has a musical track that must be used as a guide to perform specific moves such as hitting enemies, jumping gaps and striking musical plants in the background. Thanks to the game’s intuitive two-button control system, picking up the basics is really simple… but that doesn’t mean that saving Princess Ariana from the Noizoids is going to be easy!"
