	"synopsis": "Renegade was a highly influential benchmark in the beat ‘em up genre. Step into the shoes of a vigilante who must battle his way through subways, parks, alleyways and parking lots. You can even burn rubber on a motorcycle. Pick up items like a hamburger that restores life, a heart that increases your lives by one and an item that gives your bike a boost. You’ll need all the help you can get to take out the many street punks, killer kung-fu females, outlaw bikers and array of bosses standing in your way."
