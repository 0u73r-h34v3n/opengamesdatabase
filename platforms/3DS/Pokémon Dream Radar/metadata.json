	"synopsis": "In the game you’ll be taking on the role of an assistant who works for Professor Burnet - a scientist studying the Interdream Zone. Move your Nintendo 3DS system around in this motion-controlled action game and take aim to shoot your light beam at the Dream Clouds and collect your rewards! This game is fun for anybody, and a fact-filled accompaniment to Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2. Any caught Pokémon or items you pick up in Pokémon Dream Radar can be transferred to Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2, which is very useful, since the Pokémon you catch might have hidden abilities not available for those games, and some items that can’t normally be found either. Try to fill up your Pokédex as much as you can!"
