With their plane in pieces and a gang of thieving scoundrels running off with the important parts, the unfortunate duo's only hope of escape is to embark on a thrilling chase across a haunted island. Miles & Kilo is a super tough, fast-paced action platformer. Each of the game's 36 levels can be cleared without stopping, making it a perfect choice for fans of speedrunning! Both Miles and Kilo have their own diverse sets of moves and abilities. Miles can wall-jump, slide, punch, and toss fruit at pesky critters whereas Kilo can somersault through breakable walls and dash through the air to pounce on nearby baddies. A special Time Attack mode is unlocked after beating Story Mode. Can you finish the game with the fastest possible time and the fewest deaths? • A fast-paced, lovingly-crafted platformer from the creators of Kid Tripp • 36 super-challenging levels, including 5 exciting boss fights • Achievements and an unlockable time attack mode, offering loads of replayability • A fun, light-hearted story told with a retro flair • A totally rad chiptune soundtrack by Chris Kukla"
