	"synopsis": "Released on Game Boy in 1990, this version of QIX has not lost its appeal! QIX is an acclaimed arcade classic in which your goal is to capture areas of the playing field by drawing Stix (lines) with your marker. Capture the playing field step by step by drawing more and more closed shapes, but avoid the unpredictably moving, sticklike Qix and the Sparx traversing the edges. Perform well enough and you might even see Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach make an appearance! This version of the game does not have multiplayer functionality."
