Take out enemies in the distance with ninja throwing stars before they shoot or charge towards you. Absorb Spirit from each enemy you defeat and use it to summon powerful heroes that you've rescued on your journey. Make use of their powers including firewalls, ice pillars, cyclones, quakes and even flight as you come face to face with greater and greater foes on your journey to find the missing Beast Brigade!"
