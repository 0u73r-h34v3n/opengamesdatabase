	"synopsis": "Strategy, skill and determination. It takes all three to win in Baseball! Choose a starting pitcher from your bullpen (Mario is an old favourite). Hurl fastballs past the batter. If he connects, your outfield backs up to snag a fly. A sturdy infield backs you up on grounders and pop-ups. Three outs later and your team is up. Take a strike to feel out the pitcher. Then drive a long one. It's a home run! You can even choose between American or Japanese-style modes. This version of the game does not have multiplayer functionality."
