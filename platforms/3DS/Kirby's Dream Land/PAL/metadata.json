Suddenly, a spry little boy named Kirby happened along and said \"Don't worry, I'll get your food and your Sparkling Stars back!\". In Kirby's Dream Land, you guide Kirby through a series of side-scrolling action stages. Kirby can walk, fly, inhale and defeat enemies - everything he needs to make it through Mt. Dedede!"
