You never have to sit out in a couch session of Super Smash Bros.™ for Wii U again, as Smash Controller transforms your Nintendo 3DS™ system into your own controller for the game. It also enables you to conveniently bring along your own customized fighters, no matter whose Wii U™ console you're playing on. Any system from the Nintendo 3DS™ family can be used as a Smash Controller. All of the up to eight players in a game of Super Smash Bros.™ for Wii U can play using their own Nintendo 3DS system, each with a copy of Smash Controller or Super Smash Bros.™ for Nintendo 3DS."
