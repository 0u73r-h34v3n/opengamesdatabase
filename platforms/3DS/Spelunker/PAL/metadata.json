Swing from ropes and ladders, make use of mining carts and boats, collect jewels, sacks of money and more as you navigate the hazardous terrain. You must keep your wits about you, as the caves hold many dangers. Scalding steam vents, venomous bats and the avenging spirits of old spelunkers lurk in every corner of this massive labyrinth!"
