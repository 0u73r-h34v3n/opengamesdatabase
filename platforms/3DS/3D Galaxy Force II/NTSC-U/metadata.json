As the star pilot of the governing Space Federation, it’s up to you to strap yourself into your TRY-X and turn the tables on Halcyon. Re-mastered in 3D, Galaxy Force II 3D features drastically improved visuals and supports 16:9 wide screen and GamePad Pro. Arcade fans can now also enjoy Galaxy Force II in Arcade Cabinet mode!"
