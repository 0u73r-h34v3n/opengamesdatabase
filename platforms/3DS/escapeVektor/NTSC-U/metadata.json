There is a whole world to uncover within your CPU! Hiding away are 150 levels (nodes), 27 worlds (zones) and 4 unique abilities to unlock and upgrade. Vektor will allow you to Detonate to destroy enemies, Boost and Super Boost to out run them and Boostenate to smash your way through, you are sure to be able to help him escape! Online leaderboards allow you to compete against your friends, those in your location and those closest to you in score.
