Through each story-themed stage, tilt your Nintendo 3DS system to slosh Eddy through the world; solving puzzles and defeating the evil Goop. Eddy can transform too. As a block of ice, he can stick to walls, while as a cloud he can summon lightning and rain. Get ready to take Eddy for a spin, on an adventure thatâ€™s anything but dry. In some game stages, background text not relevant to the gameplay experience has been kept in English for atmospheric reasons."
