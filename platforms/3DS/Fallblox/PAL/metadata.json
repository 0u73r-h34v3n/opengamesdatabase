	"synopsis": "Welcome to the world of Fallblox! Get ready to push your brain to the limit with 140 new levels, 90 training exercises and a unique addition to the puzzling gameplay: gravity! Fallblox might look familiar if you’ve already played its predecessor, Pullblox, but don’t be fooled! New gameplay elements help make Fallblox a totally new experience and one that’ll have you scratching your head for a long time to come! As in Pullblox, the objective of each level is to reach the top of the structure – where he previously rescued children, Mallo now has to save the colourful birds that are trapped at the top of each stage. But while the coloured blocks of Pullblox could only be pulled outwards or pushed inwards, Fallblox adds a third dimension and a whole new layer of challenge to the puzzle experience!"
