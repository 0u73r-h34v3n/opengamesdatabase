	"synopsis": "Excave is back with even more challenging dungeons and a more varied ensemble of terrible foes! Excave II is a classic JRPG style dungeon hack and slash game wherein you take the role of one of two adventurers, tasked with returning order to a progressively more chaotic city. Each adventurer has their own attacking style and hundreds of items and weaponry to discover! Unlike other RPG's, there is no leveling up system, instead the player's equipment determines how strong they are - find legendary weapons to smash your way through! Progress requires careful planning and thought - come ill prepared with weapons and equipment that are not targeting a specific enemies weakpoints then only doom awaits."
