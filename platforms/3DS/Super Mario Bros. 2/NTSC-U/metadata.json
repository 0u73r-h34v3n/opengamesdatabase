Each character has a unique set of abilities: Luigi can jump higher and farther than any of the other characters, Toad can dig extremely fast and pull items out of the ground quicker than anyone, and the princess is the only one who can jump and hover temporarily. This unique installment in the Mario series will keep you coming back for more!"
