	"synopsis": "Join Mario and company on a journey to save the world of Subcon from the foul frog tyrant, Wart. Super Mario Bros. 2 offered freedom to explore levels not only horizontally but also vertically; while collecting power-ups, uprooting veggies to throw at enemies and seeking out hidden ‘Sub-space’ rooms. It was the first Mario title to let players control other characters like Princess Toadstool (Peach) and Toad; each with their own skills. It also featured the first appearance of many Mario series regulars, including Shy Guy and Birdo."
