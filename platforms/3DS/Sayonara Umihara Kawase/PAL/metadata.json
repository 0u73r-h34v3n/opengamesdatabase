Featuring a girl armed with only with her backpack and trusty fishing hook, this travelling sushi chef departs on a journey in a dream-like world filled with fish and other wildlife gone awry. You will need to think how to get out of the stages like a puzzle game, and learn to use the hook to get out ASAP, action game-style. You will also be able to `restart` from the checkpoints, and `slow` to move carefully and avoid failing. On top, if you connect to the internet, you will see your ranking among players in your territory!"
