	"synopsis": "Years ago, a tunnel connected the livestock-loving Bluebell Village with the crop-growing town of Konohana, but boisterous bickering between the burgs created a cave-in and collapsed the tunnel! Build a bustling farm, befriend the villagers and maybe you can find a way to bring these towns together once again!"
