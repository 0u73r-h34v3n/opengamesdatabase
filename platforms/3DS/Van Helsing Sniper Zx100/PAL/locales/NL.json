	"synopsis": "If you like sniper arcade games and hunting vampires, there's nothing better than reincarnating as the best Vampire exterminator of all time: Van Helsing!!! Take aim in the most natural way there is with your Nintendo 3DS™. With the motion sensor, turn your Nintendo 3DS™ into a mortal crossbow against the Vampires. If your hand trembles a bit, don't worry: the option of slowing down time will help you aim with greater precision during difficult moments, as well as finding hidden Vampires with a special filter. Search, aim and fire with resolve on all the blood-thirsty Vampires that are stalking humans in London, and face the terrifying Bosses. You can also unlock a survival minigame if you earn the cursed score of 6 6 6 (pts)."
