	"synopsis": "The third game in the legendary Ghosts’n Goblins series, Super Ghouls’n Ghosts follows brave Sir Arthur’s quest through demon-infested lands to rescue the kidnapped princess. Battle through deadly stages and beat each level’s boss to progress. But watch out: if Arthur is injured his armour breaks, leaving him only in his boxer shorts! Originally developed exclusively for Super NES™, this supremely challenging platformer won critical acclaim and became an instant bestseller. This is the US version of the game."
