	"synopsis": "Tiny Games – Knights & Dragons is the first in a series of mini-games collections for kids. Its look and gameplay is designed for kids, and the games offer a diverting experience with age-appropriate session lengths. The collection offers these 5 games: Ludo: A board game where you throw dice and try to be first to move four tokens to your own home base. Chest Mover Mania: A puzzle game where you move a chest to a target. No easy feat, as the board is restricted and you can't pull the chest. Ship Encounter: An exciting tactics game. Hide your own ships well, and carefully consider the target for your next cannon ball. Find Mines: A math game that poses the tricky task of finding mines on a field. Your only clue: The number of mines in adjacent fields. 4 in a row: A tactics game where you try to get a row of four tokens – before your opponent does!"
