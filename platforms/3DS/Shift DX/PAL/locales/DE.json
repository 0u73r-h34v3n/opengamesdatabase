	"name": "Shift DX",
	"synopsis": "Shift DX marks the return of the classic Shift series. The game will feature all of the levels contained in Shift 1 and 2, along with 100 all-new levels designed specially for this release. Many have tried to emulate the gameplay of Shift since its first release in 2008, but none have managed to capture the frantic, mind-bending nature of the series. Players are tasked with making their way through a series of perplexing rooms, equipped with nothing more than their ability to “shift” the playing field. Is a wall blocking you from progressing? Flip that level upside down and turn that wall into a pit! Of course, that’s only the beginning of the challenges players will encounter in Shift DX. The road to victory is paved with mysterious items, complex environmental puzzles, and a variety of deadly traps. Features: - Over 100 brand-new puzzles - Shift 1 and Shift 2 levels included - New Shift Challenge gameplay mode - Create levels with the Level Editor - Share levels online as QR Codes - \"Pop-Art\" and \"Classic\" visual modes - Unlockable playable avatars from indie games"
