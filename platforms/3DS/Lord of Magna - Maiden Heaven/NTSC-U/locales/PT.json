	"name": "Lord of Magna - Maiden Heaven",
	"synopsis": "Residing on the outskirts of town as the proprietor of a quiet, rustic inn, Luchs has lived through much of his life proudly clinging to a code of honor passed down from father to son: \"When our cherished guests finally arrive, think of them as nothing less than family.\" Unfortunately, the inn has not yet had even a single guest since its foundation, leaving Luchs no choice but to excavate and sell crystals—a valuable fuel source—in order to make ends meet. It is during one such routine excavation that he happens upon a beautiful maiden encased inside a massive crystal, and her abrupt awakening triggers a series of unexpected events that include foul fiends, astonishing abilities, and miraculous mysteries… \"Bowl\" over as many enemies with a single strike as possible in this new RPG from the producer of STORY OF SEASONS and Rune Factory, challenging players to line up melee, ranged, and magical attacks so frontline enemies are knocked into others for maximum collateral damage!"
