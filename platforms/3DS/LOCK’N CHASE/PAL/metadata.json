	"synopsis": "The chase is on, to catch a master thief. He’s fast, sneaky and runs rings around the cops. No bank is safe from…you! In classic arcade action game LOCK’N CHASE you must dash around the maze-like bank vaults, grabbing all the coins while avoiding the guards. As you progress, the banks get bigger and the riches become greater; but the guards get tougher, too. Fortunately, snatching a diamond means the law can’t touch you, for a short time at least. You know what they say; no risk, no reward!"
