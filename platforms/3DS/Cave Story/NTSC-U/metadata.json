You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. While uncovering the Mimiga Village, you discover that the once-carefree Mimiga are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. Their only hope rests squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name. Take control and learn the origins of this worldâ€™s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!"
