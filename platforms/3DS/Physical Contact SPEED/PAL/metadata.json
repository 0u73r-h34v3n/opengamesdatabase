Any two partners, including parents, friends, lover, etc, are suitable. Because it is simple and rules that everyone knows, you can start the game immediately on the spot. If you use the handicap function you can match the level of the two people. Because the match-up time is short, I can play anytime and anywhere when I feel like it. Of course there is also a 1P play mode for one's time. Please enjoy together! \"SPEED\" is one of simple and profound card games that will win if you use up your hand first.
