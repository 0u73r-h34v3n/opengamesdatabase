Take on the role of Trevor Belmont, forefather of Simon, and battle Dracula in a time long before the events of the first two Castlevania games. In addition to his trusty whip, Trevor has a power never before seen--the ability to transform into one of three different companion spirits that he meets at various points in his quest: Syfa, a young vampire hunter capable of powerful magic; Grant, a ferocious pirate who can climb on walls; and Alucard, forgotten son of Dracula, able to shoot fireballs and transform into a bat. Lead on with bravery as you overcome 17 levels of never-ending horror. Use an assortment of weapons (some specific to each character) as you choose which path to follow in your fight against Dracula and his army."
