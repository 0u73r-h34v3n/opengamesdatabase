Something must be done… In Bravely Default, quest through Luxendarc to awaken the crystals in a unique and innovative RPG experience, only on Nintendo 3DS family systems. Meet mysterious allies and terrible foes from all corners of the world, and best your enemies in instantly accessible turn-based battles.
