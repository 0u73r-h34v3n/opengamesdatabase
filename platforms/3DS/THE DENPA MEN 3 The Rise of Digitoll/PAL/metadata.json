This time, some Denpa Men can capture monsters, turning them into allies who can be summoned to your side. Capture powerful monsters to turn the tide of battle. Also, your Denpa Men friends now have their own little homes, which can be customized and decorated to suit your style. Online play is now better than ever. Trade items with players worldwide, and lend or borrow Denpa Men. You can import your hero and bring all your friends from the previous two THE “DENPA” MEN titles, too."
