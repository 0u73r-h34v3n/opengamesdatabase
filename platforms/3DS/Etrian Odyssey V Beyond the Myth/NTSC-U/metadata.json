For it is said that whoever braves the dangers of the dreaded Yggdrasil Labyrinth and reaches the summit will have their greatest wish fulfilled. Each culture has their own myth, some say great power will be granted, others believe the great mysteries will be solved. Some believe the ultimate techniques can be mastered there, and a number believe the lost treasures can be found at the top of the Yggdrasil Tree’s boughs. There's a reason why no one has ever reached the top. Dangerous creatures and terrifying FOEs roam the labyrinth on every floor, so prepare to test your mettle with challenging turn-based battles.
