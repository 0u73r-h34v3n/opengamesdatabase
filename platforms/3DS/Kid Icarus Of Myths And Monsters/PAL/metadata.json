	"synopsis": "First there was Kid Icarus for NES (and now 3D Classics for Nintendo 3DS) in which angelic warrior Pit fought against the forces of Medusa. Five years later, Pit returned in Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters for Game Boy; expanding on the original vertical-scrolling action game with a side-scrolling action-adventure, as Pit faces off against the forces of the mysterious demon Orcos. It would take 20 years for Pit to take flight again, in Kid Icarus: Uprising for Nintendo 3DS!"
