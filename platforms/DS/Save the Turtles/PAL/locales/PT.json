Players must use the stylus to rub and tap the Touch Screen on the Nintendo DSi, digging eggs from the sand and lining-up cute reptiles while avoiding crabs, seagulls and litter on their way to the safety of the sea. The game features four game modes, including a never ending survival mode called \"Turtles forever\", and several unlockable trophies. Give Mother Nature a hand and help Save the Turtles!"
