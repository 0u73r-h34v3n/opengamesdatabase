Save the Turtles boasts multiple gameplay modes, an animated flare reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon bursting with exuberant colors, real life environmental issues and puzzles that increase in complexity. Set in real world beach locations, the defenseless sea turtles venture into an unforgiving tropical environment and require safekeeping against predators such as the ever-resourceful seagull and the crafty pincer crab. Other perilous dangers players must navigate sea turtles through as they embark on their quest to safety include overexposure to the humid sun and manmade hazards such as oil spills and garbage. Save the Turtles features four addictively captivating game modes that include “Save the World,” “Quick Play,” “Tidal Wave” and “Turtles Forever.” “Save the World” presents 32 levels of challenging fun as fans try to save all seven species of baby sea turtles using the Nintendo DSi™ stylus to hatch uncovered eggs from out of the golden sand. Players must organize as many lines of hatched turtles as possible while keeping a careful eye out for perilous dangers before each wave whisks them to safety, thus building combos and racking up more points. “Quick Play” allows fans to instantly jump into the action and enjoy the satisfaction of immediate gameplay. Additional game modes include “Tidal Wave” where players will at the mercy of the wind and its frictional drag over the ocean’s surface that creates waves at random intervals, forcing a revising of strategic gameplay. “Turtles Forever” provides fans with proving ground to achieve the highest possible score by saving as many turtles as possible while facing increasingly difficult challenges."
