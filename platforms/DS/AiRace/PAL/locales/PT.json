	"synopsis": "AiRace - the first high-octane, adrenaline-fueled air, speed and stunt game for Nintendo DSi. AiRace is not your typical handheld racing game – it’s high-sky racing at its best. There are no limits to your flight with 360° movement and unique steering with the Nintendo DSi stylus. AiRace offers you a chance to control one of nine planes and compete against AI or human opponents in six exotic locations. With great physics, plane upgrades, on-the-track power-ups and unique maps, AiRace offers a little bit more than your average racing experience. Now it’s time to leave your cars and switch to aeroplanes."
