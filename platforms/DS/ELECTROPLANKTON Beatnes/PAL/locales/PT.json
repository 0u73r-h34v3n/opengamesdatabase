	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Beatnes are curious creatures that emit sounds closely resembling those of the classic NES game console. Tapping the eight unique parts of a Beatnesâ€™ body produces different sounds. Tap rhythmically to produce a repeating note in perfect time. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
