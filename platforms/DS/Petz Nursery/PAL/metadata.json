Adopt your very own kittens, bond with them, and help them grow into strong and healthy cats. • Choose from a variety of popular cat breeds including Siamese, Maine Coon and Persian. • Cuddle your cute newborn just like a mum would: give them milk, keep them clean, make sure their temperature is warm enough and give them all the love they deserve. • Watch your baby pets evolve and surprise you. Provoke unpredictable behaviours and memorable moments. They have unique reactions and they do lots of unexpected, funny and silly things.
