Your mission is to swim, fly and run through these Worlds collecting baby Oscars that have become scattered throughout the levels, armed with your secret weapon, a Yo-Yo that you can use to swing from platform to platform and also zap those nasty enemies in some of the craziest platform levels youâ€™ll ever play."
