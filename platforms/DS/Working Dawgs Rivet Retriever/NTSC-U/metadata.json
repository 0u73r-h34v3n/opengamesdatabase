	"synopsis": "Building the latest construction project requires teamwork, quick reflexes, and dogged determination! Working Dawg Mac has his paws on the rivet gun to fasten the beams together, but he needs a steady supply of rivets to finish the job. It's up to you to guide the main character Ace to retrieve enough of the rivets scattered across each construction site and deliver them to Mac before time expires. This is no simple game of fetch for Ace. Birds, bees, and cats are causing the Working Dawgs trouble, and Ace will have to evade, jump, or spin-attack them out of his way. Every missed jump or animal attack will spill rivets from Ace's bucket. Other moving obstacles on the construction site can be trouble for Ace and his bucket of rivets, too. So watch your step up high on the beams! Rivet Retriever features 20 levels to challenge even the best trained Working Dawg. Complete each level once to advance, them come back and play again to find more rivets, and set new best times."
