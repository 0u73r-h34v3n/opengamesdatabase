	"synopsis": "Take your time, set your own pace, establish your own goals and adapt your play style to whatever you feel is more fun. Primrose rules are easy: There are no time limits, no levels or arbitrary objectives and no constraints. You must place pairs of tiles on a game grid and attempt to corral groups of tiles with pieces of a different colour. When that happens, surrounded tiles disappear and surrounding tiles change colours, allowing chain effects to trigger combos for massive points. You can play for long matches, surviving against the increasing difficulty, or just go all out on a huge single move combo of millions of points. Relax, enjoy and welcome to Primrose."
