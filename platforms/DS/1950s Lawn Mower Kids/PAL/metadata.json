Control time and speed with Mr. Mowman's mysterious contraptions. Lead the kids Tom, Nancy and Tim out of danger. Avoid mowing down intricate flowerbeds, crashing into well laid tables and angry animals. The key to success is keeping all three kids moving and to use the abilities of each kid to your advantage. Remember, ill tempered old Joe will keep an eye out for sloppy children that mow down his flowers!"
