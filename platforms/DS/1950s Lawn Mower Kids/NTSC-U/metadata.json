Control time and speed with Mr. Mowman's mysterious contraptions and lead the kids Tom, Nancy and Tim out of danger. Avoid mowing down intricate flowerbeds, crashing into well-laid tables and angry animals. The key to success is keeping all three kids moving and to use the abilities of each kid to your advantage. Remember, ill-tempered old Joe will keep an eye out for sloppy children that mow down his flowers!"
