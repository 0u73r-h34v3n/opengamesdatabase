	"synopsis": "Meet professor Topoloco. He's absolutely crazy about topography and he is glad to have you in his world topography class! For each of the 5 continents he covers you can practise your skills in a series of mini-games like locating cities and countries, dragging flags, and more! You can practise as much as you want in order to prepare for a final exam which you can take whenever you think you're ready. Topoloco is both a fun topography learning game and a digital atlas for all ages."
