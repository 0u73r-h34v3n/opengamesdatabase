	"synopsis": "With Mario Clock, you'll always have the time wherever you go! Wake up with classic Mario music, or simply use the Nintendo DSi system as a desktop clock complete with a Super Mario Bros. background. You can even make Mario jump, bash blocks and collect coins! Customise the clock to your liking: choose from analogue or digital displays, 12-hour or 24-hour modes, and set up to three separate alarms with different NES-style Mario tunes or use your own saved sounds from the Nintendo DSi Sound application."
