Or even play your favourite pen and paper games (games not included). You can even personalise your notebook by drawing on the cover and changing the paper type with 18 different unlockable squared and lined paper styles. Use the pen or pencil to make your notes or doodles and then erase the bits you don't like. With 5 ink colours you'll always be able to make your notes and doodles look stylish."
