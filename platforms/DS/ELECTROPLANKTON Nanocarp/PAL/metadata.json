	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Nanocarp have very sensitive hearing, and they react to sounds like clapping or whistling. They swim in formations of 16 and emit sounds when they sense ripples on the waterâ€™s surface. Their pitch changes depending on their location on the water. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
