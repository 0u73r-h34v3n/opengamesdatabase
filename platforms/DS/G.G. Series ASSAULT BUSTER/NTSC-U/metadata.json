Pit yourself against wave after wave of enemy forces while using your high speed boost maneuver to fly in 8 different directions to avoid fire with the goal of total enemy annihilation. Defeating any enemies on screen will decrease the \"enemy potential\" gauge which will give way to a powerful boss upon reaching zero. Keep an eye out for flying cargo boxes which will yield helpful items if destroyed. Hold your ground as the Assault Buster!"
