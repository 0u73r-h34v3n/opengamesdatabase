	"synopsis": "Ashton Eaton’s world record of 9039 points is shaking on thin ice... The time has come for a competition in the premiere athletic discipline – the decathlon. After hard training only the most versatile athlete will win. Every error will be mercilessly penalized and the chance to create a new world record will vanish away in the London fog. 10 games in one: 100 metres sprint, long jump, shot-put, high jump, 400 metres run, 110 metres hurdles, discus , pole vault, javelin throw and finally the exhausting 1500 metres. In each discipline you control your athlete simply with the stylus, but you won’t succeed without proper timing, speed and stamina management. Results achieved in individual disciplines are stored in a table and compared with the best world scores. The total score in the decathlon is calculated using a real-world formula, thus it is possible to accurately compare your score not only to the world record but also to the other athletes participating in the competition, including up to three friends with whom you take turns during the game. Enjoy a stylish design which naturally complements the great playability of original sports games but this time you do not have to worry about breaking your joystick. During the track events you have to move the stylus with the correct frequency and not waste your stamina. When jumping, you have to attain the necessary speed and time your take-off correctly and when throwing you won’t succeed without totally concentrating on your technique. Only one athlete will get the gold medal for his country. • 10 disciplines, a training mode and a competition for the gold medal. • A visual assistant for easier training in the disciplines. • Accurate control using the stylus. • A selection of 32 national representations. • Game for 1 to 4 players. • A world records table. • A stylish design in the style of classic sporting games."
