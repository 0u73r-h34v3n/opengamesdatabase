	"synopsis": "Get ready to soil your plants in the zombie-zapping phenomenon from PopCap! A mob of fun-loving zombies is about to invade your home, and the only defence is your arsenal of home-guardin’ plants. You’ll have to think fast and plant faster as you fight the fun-dead through day, night, fog, in the swimming pool and on the roof. Dig into Adventure mode and get more zombie-zapping action in 20 minigames, including the all-new Zombie Trap. The fun never dies! Available languages: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian."
