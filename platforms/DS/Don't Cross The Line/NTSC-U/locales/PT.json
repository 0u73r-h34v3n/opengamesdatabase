There are roughly 50 stages in all. Depending on how quickly each stage is completed, the player will be awarded with either a bronze, silver, or gold award. To unlock further stages, the player must get a certain ranking in previous stages in order to move on. Can you outwit the puzzles at hand and receive gold awards all around? Remember, Don't Cross The Line!"
