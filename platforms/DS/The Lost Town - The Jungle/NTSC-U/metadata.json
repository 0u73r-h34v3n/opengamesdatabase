	"synopsis": "The red headed killer is back! In 1997, a meteorite landed within the Amazon jungle, consuming the land in darkness. The effects of the meteorite caused villagers, and animals to go insane. The villagers that resisted the effects of the meteorite have become prey for those under the influence of its darkness. A girl named Chilia appears in the jungle. Behind her beautiful exterior hides elite combat skills that will be used to help the Amazon get rid of the mysterious meteorite. Youâ€™re aware of your skills, but you also need to find food, ammunition, and other resources for survival. Sane villagers will provide rewarding quests in the daytime, but when the sun goes down, you will need to set traps around camp and recruit assistants to keep things safe. In this mission, you must locate the meteorite; the area will be swarming with opposition. Its effects on people and animals will vanish if you are successful. There will be no rescue team, so success is the only option."
