	"synopsis": "Looking great can make you feel great and facing the world with confidence is something that everybody deserves, but sometimes your tried and tested style can begin to feel a little stale and a fresh new image is the only solution. The question is: what to go for? Nobody wants their makeover to be a make-under! As the first Nintendo DSi-exclusive release, Hair Salon allows you to get a sneak preview before you go for the chop or simply have fun creating riotous new styles â€“ just snap a photo of yourself or a friend using the cameras of the Nintendo DSi to try out something new with zero commitment."
