	"synopsis": "While some of them are laundering money, literally putting any object they find into a washing machine to get money in exchange, others eat everything they can to \"shape\" the process. Whatever the dream, the Dalton Brothers always have two things in common: their love for their mother and their ability to cause spectacular accidents wherever they go: to the bank, to jail or even to the casino."
