	"synopsis": "Rytmik World Music is an application for creating rhythmical and melodic themes, and for composing entire songs. Its user interface blends the fast and well-arranged interface of classic drum machines with a flexible pattern interface of popular trackers and a modern sound library. It contains 117 carefully-picked, authentic sounds of ethnic drums and percussion, as well as plucked, mallet, bowed and wind instruments, which are complemented by a selection of synth drums, basses and pads, together creating a strong and creative mix of sounds and rhythms for your compositions – not just from the sphere of world music. Compositions being played are visualised on the upper screen in the classical demoscene style with 20 types of visualisation to choose from. Moreover, the application contains a rhythm library and a varied collection of pre-made compositions that you may use to quickly compose your own pieces. For the best musical experience, we recommend connecting headphones or a quality speaker system. With Rytmik World Music you can quickly and easily create the basic building stone: an audio clip, which consists of musical notations for up to four instruments that you may transpose. Select their location in the stereo field, and modify their volume, reverse, shuffle (rhythm twist) and polyphony (with extended polyphony handling), plus chorus/widening stereo effect, echo and arpeggiator. You may, arbitrarily, combine up to 128 such clips in four tracks and create complex pieces of music. Moreover, you have a collection of 11 pre-made compositions at your disposal, from which you may quickly compose your own pieces. Rytmik World Music is not only for playing with sounds; in the hands of a skilful musician it can become a serious musical instrument – a surprisingly powerful pocket music station. For the best musical experience, we recommend connecting headphones or a quality speaker system. You’ll become the king of the party in no time..."
