	"synopsis": "Aliens from all over the universe have traveled to the moon to take part in the intergalactic lunar race. But there are owls in the lunar moss - because while the lunar race is going on, someone is about to destroy the moon. Admittedly, the flunkers are a bit insidious and rude, but to destroy the moon, they would never have done."
