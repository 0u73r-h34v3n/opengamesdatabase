	"synopsis": "Dictionary 6 in 1 with Camera Function is no ordinary dictionary; it transforms your Nintendo DSi into a unique language tool. Enter a word by hand, or simply snap a photo of it, to receive an instant translation. Thousands of everyday words and expressions in six different languages are included: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese. Use the Touch Screen to enter a word via the on-screen keyboard or write the letters by hand using the stylus. Alternatively, use the camera to take a photo of a word – such as in a magazine or on a sign – and the software will do the rest and translate it. Dictionary 6 in 1 with Camera Function is useful when travelling, for casual study, or anytime you need to brush up your knowledge of foreign words. This product does not require age classification."
