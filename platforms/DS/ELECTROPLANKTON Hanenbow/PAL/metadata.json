	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Hanenbow launch themselves out of the water towards floating plants, creating strange sounds and melodies as they bounce off the leaves. When a leaf is repeatedly hit by a Hanenbow, it changes colour, altering the sound produced. No-one knows why Hanenbow display this strange behaviour. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
