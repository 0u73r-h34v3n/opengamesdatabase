When your ninja touches a platform, it will automatically disappear and he will jump, making for pretty unstable footing! But where some see obstacles, a ninja sees opportunity. You will be forced to think on your feet, push your reflexes, and bend the very rules of physics to conquer your treacherous surroundings. Master the art of the dash, shuriken, and sword. Be a ninja."
