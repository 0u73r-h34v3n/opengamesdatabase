The player sets out to save the world from a mysterious chemical attack and armed with Professor Weinstein's Pseudo-quark Generator Gun, the player must neutralise packs of differently-coloured quarks over the course of thirty-five stages, by matching three quarks of the same colour. Can you help stem the tide and save the world?"
