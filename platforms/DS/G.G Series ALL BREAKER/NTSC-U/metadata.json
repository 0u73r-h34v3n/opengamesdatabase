They've holed up in their enormous base made of blocks, but Rebecca's speciality is wielding her massive hammer. Smash all the target blocks in each stage to proceed but avoid enemies and use well placed strikes to the surrounding blocks to take out your enemies or to clear a path to destroy the target blocks before the time runs out or your lives expire!"
