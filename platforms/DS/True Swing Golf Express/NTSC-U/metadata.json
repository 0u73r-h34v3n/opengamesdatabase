True Swing Golf Express is a realistic golf simulation that makes full use of the Touch Screen to offer in-depth control over your actions. Vary shot power, apply topspin or backspin, and more, all with a touch of your stylus. Beginners or experts alike can choose from two main modes. Round mode offers play across 3-, 9-, or 18-hole courses, each with varying difficulty levels and some in an exciting tournament setting. Challenge mode puts a unique spin on golf, with a wide selection of special tasks to complete. Completing these tasks in Challenge mode allows you to improve your characterâ€™s skills and unlock new courses in Round mode. The fairway awaits!"
