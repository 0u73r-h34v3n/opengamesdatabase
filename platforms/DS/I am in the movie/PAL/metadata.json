	"synopsis": "By using real time visual effects, this software literally puts you inside famous Hollywood movies. Now you can be the actor or director and recreate famous scenes or create your own ones. You might have seen video tutorials on YouTube that show you how to recreate visual effects from movies. But to create similar videos, you must own expensive editing software and invest a considerable amount of time to learn how to use the software. With this software however, you can create Hollywood-like special effect videos in seconds. The program alters the video feed from the Nintendo DSi camera in real time, using image processing. It can reproduce visual effects from various famous Hollywood movies. It lets you customise the special effects, take photos and record YouTube videos. Features: - Use special effects like thermal vision, cloaking, morphing, explosions and more - Record short video clips and save them to the SD card (as .avi) - Record your own sound effects and use them in your videos - Customise any effect to your liking (change speed, edit text, add sound and more) - Snap photos and save them to the platform: Photo Album or to the SD card (as .bmp)"
