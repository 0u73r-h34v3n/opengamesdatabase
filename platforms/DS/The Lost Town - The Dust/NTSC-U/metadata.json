After a full week of heavy rain, there was a massive explosion at a bio-chemical military facility located on the outskirts of the town due to a power outage. A beautiful red haired girl, Chilia, with deep red eyes emerged from the darkness. Possessing incredible combat skills, you must utilize her abilities to search for survivors of the town before nightfall. Other objectives include setting traps, collecting items, and using various weapons to defeat unknown creatures. The more you experience battle, the more skills you gain. During nightfall the danger level increases, so you will need the help of survivors in the camp to protect it for a course of seven days. You must fight off vicious creatures starving for their next meal until the rescue team arrives, but until then, you are their only hope for survival."
