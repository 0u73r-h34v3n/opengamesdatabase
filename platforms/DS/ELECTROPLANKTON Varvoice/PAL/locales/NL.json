	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Varvoice are clever plankton that can memorise human voices and repeat them over and over. As their shape changes, so too does the tone of the voice they play back. As well as adding their own unique sound to voices, Varvoice can also play back voices in reverse. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
