	"synopsis": "A strange electronic sea awaits you. In this sea, youâ€™ll encounter unique species of tiny Electroplankton that respond to your touch and voice to create unforgettable sounds and melodies. Enjoy getting to know these fascinating plankton as you relax to their sights and sounds! Normally an aquatic creature, Hanenbow sometimes use floating leaves to launch themselves out of the water, creating strange sounds and melodies as they bounce off of leaves. Entire schools of Hanenbow have been known to launch out of the water, one after another! As a leaf is repeatedly hit by flying Hanenbow, it gradually changes color. This also alters the sound made by bouncing Hanenbow. When all of the leaves turn red, a flower will bloom. It is still unclear why the Hanenbow display this curious behavior."
