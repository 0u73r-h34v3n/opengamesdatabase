	"synopsis": "In Art Style: AQUITE, feel the pressure in a race against time to clear panels from an undersea pipe â€“ the more you clear, the deeper your diver goes. Fail to clear panels and the Pressure Line will descend, clouding your vision and increasing the difficulty tenfold! As well as the main Interval Dive mode, try Endless Dive to test your endurance, and even visit the Aquarium to meet the many creatures that share your ocean!"
