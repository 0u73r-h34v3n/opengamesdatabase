Imminent Forecast: Total Destruction!!! The human race will face its Armageddon, unless you can stop it. There is no weapon powerful enough to destroy or even divert it from its Earth-bound trajectory. Only an amount of energy greater than what our sun produces could prevent it. That magnitude of energy is located outside of our solar system, at the 4 cardinal points of the galaxy. At those coordinates are the planets: Upsil-on, Magnet-on, Fusi-on and Dark-on. Visit each planet to collect the greatest amount of energy and the mission will be a complete success. Humanity will die out some day, but not this time! Be brave! It's in your hands to prevent it! Features: 32 levels (4 planets with 8 levels each) Runner playability Touch control and easy handling Amazing, innovative graphics Local ranking"
