	"synopsis": "Spread your wings with this irresistibly simple action game for one or two players! Simply manoeuvre the paper plane through a winding course - and don't collide with the obstacles. But that's easier said than done! In Endless Mode, the longer you survive through the randomly-generated course, the higher your score. Or try Time Attack Mode to complete special courses as quickly as possible. You can also play together with a friend in Race Mode. Each player takes one side of the Nintendo DSi system to control and race with their own paper plane! Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
