Mind Probe uses the Nintendo DSi system's built-in microphone in magical new ways! Ask a spectator to write down the names of six people, including someone they really like, and then ask them to read the names into the microphone. Amazingly, the software will detect who the spectator's favourite is! This trick can also reveal spectators' other likes and dislikes - for example, their favourite foods or films. You can even experiment and use the trick as a lie detector!"
