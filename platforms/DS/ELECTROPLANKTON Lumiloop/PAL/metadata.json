Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Ring-shaped Lumiloop have the ability to spin at a very high speed. As they spin, they emit unique sounds and a pulsating glow. Usually seen in groups of five, Lumiloop produce sounds of different pitches as they spin together, creating a beautiful harmony. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
