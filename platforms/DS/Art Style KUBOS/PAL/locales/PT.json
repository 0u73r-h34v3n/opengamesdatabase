	"synopsis": "The Art Style series brings you unique, simple-to-play games with striking visuals and immersive sound. In KUBOS your aim is to climb a tower of cubes which becomes higher as new cubes drop from above. Walk across the cubes to score points, avoiding being crushed by the falling cubes; but keep climbing or youâ€™ll fall when the lower cubes disappear. In TEN FLOORS mode, try to reach the 10th floor while scoring as many points as possible. In TOWER mode, simply climb as high as you can. Quickly defuse bomb cubes before they blow a hole in your tower, and remove obstructing cubes with a gentle push or a huge Cube Blast!"
