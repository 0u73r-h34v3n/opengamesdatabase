Arcade Hoops features your choice of three rockin' soundtracks, state-of-the-art 3-D graphics and thrilling, high-speed game play for the most fun possible in under a minute. Advanced hoopsters can move on to the progressive level, where a moving basket provides an additional challenge - plus the chance to rack up even more points. For the real pros, there's 3 Point mode, where speed and accuracy are a must as you shoot \"threes\" from downtown."
