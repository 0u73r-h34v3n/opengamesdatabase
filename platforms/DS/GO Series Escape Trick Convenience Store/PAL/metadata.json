	"synopsis": "GO Series presents Escape Trick - Convenience Store from Intense. Your quiet, routine job working as a shop assistant in a local convenience store is suddenly and dramatically turned upside down. When you arrive at work there are no customers and no other staff around. Items are out of place, doors are unusually locked and there is an eerie sense that something is different. When you try to leave the shop you realise that you've been locked in. But why? And by whom? What is going on? Alone in the shop, make use of any items you can to escape and figure out the mystery behind the day's strange occurrence."
