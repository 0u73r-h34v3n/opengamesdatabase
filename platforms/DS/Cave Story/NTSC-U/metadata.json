	"synopsis": "An action-adventure game from well-known independent designer, Daisuke Amaya - or Pixel to his fans, Cave Story overflows with charm and character and takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimigas, run free. You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. On discovering Mimiga Village, you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigas’ only hope rests squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't even remember his own name. There are 15 levels to explore, over 20 boss battles and 10 unique weapons to find and upgrade. Featuring new character designs and three unique endings, it’s up to you to stop the delusional villain and save the Mimigas!"
