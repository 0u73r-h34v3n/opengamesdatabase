In the Shooter mode the prey is now the predator. You will chase down and shoot hordes of vicious viruses. It’s time to take the medicine! In the Territory mode you will protect certain zones and prevent enemies from getting too close to them. Accumulate enough energy and the zone will disappear giving you more time to smash enemies. Never stop running and dodging to avoid hostile attacks. Use all bonus items, power-ups and ammo and don’t let the enemies surpass you.
