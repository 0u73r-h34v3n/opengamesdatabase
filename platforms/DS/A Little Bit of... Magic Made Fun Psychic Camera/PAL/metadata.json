Psychic Camera appears to bestow the Nintendo DSi with incredible telepathic abilities. Simply ask a spectator to think of a card, and then take a photo of them using the Nintendo DSi system's camera function. The correct card will magically appear next to the person's face! You can also perform a variation of the trick in which the spectator thinks of a symbol instead of a card. Take the spectator's photo, and the symbol they were thinking of will appear on the screen - as if by magic!"
