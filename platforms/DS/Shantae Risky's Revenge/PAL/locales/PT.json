	"synopsis": "This is it! The sequel to the critically acclaimed Shantae! Fans asked, and WayForward answers with a powder keg of high octane, hair-whipping, hip shaking action available only on DSiWare. Shantae sets the bar even higher with thousands of frames of animation, huge multi-sprite bosses, and a quest so big it’s bursting at the seams. Guide \"half-genie\" Shantae through haunted wastes, burning deserts, enchanted forests, dripping caverns and deadly labyrinths. Discover magical attacks, brew zombie coffee, save golden babies, and master the art of belly-dancing to transform Shantae into more powerful creatures. Use your powers to foil the lady pirate Risky Boots and save Sequin Land from certain doom! With its infectious characters, flirtatious humour and deliciously outlandish action, Shantae: Risky’s Revenge offers up all the hair-whipping, belly-dancing action you can handle!"
