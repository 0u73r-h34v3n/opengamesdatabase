	"synopsis": "Nintendo first began releasing the Game & Watch series in 1980. This collection of games was available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a game and a clock. Each Game & Watch title features two modes of play: GAME A (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced play). While some controls have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the Nintendo DSi system, the appearance of the game itself has not been altered. Donkey Kong is trapped! It’s up to Donkey Kong Jr. to snag the key and set his father free from Mario’s cage. Help Donkey Kong Jr. avoid crows and alligators as he swings his way to victory! Earn points by unlocking the cage, hitting crows and alligators with pieces of food, or jumping over alligators. Receive mistake icons by running into crows and alligators or missing a jump for the key; receive three mistake icons, and it’s game over!"
