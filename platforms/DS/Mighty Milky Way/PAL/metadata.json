Prepare for fever-pitched puzzles in another mighty game from WayForward! Luna uses her magical staff to create and destroy planets on a whim. Explode vicious space monsters, avoid sizzling electric barriers, and grab all the delicious planet candy you can. But watch out for the T-Rex, Luna’s arch-nemesis! The power of his laser eyes is matched only by the animosity he has for Luna as a result of their sketchy past. But enough incessant blathering! Let’s stare unblinking into the sun and embrace the chaotic journey that is life!"
