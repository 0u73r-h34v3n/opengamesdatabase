	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Trapy are graceful swimmers and love to emit sounds as they follow lines traced along the water. Each of the six types of Trapy produce different tones depending on the direction they swim; they produce low pitch sounds when they swim to the right and high pitch sounds when they swim to the left. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
