	"synopsis": "Rytmik Rock Edition is an application for creating rhythmical and melodic themes and for composing whole songs. Its user interface blends the fast and well-arranged interface of classic drum machines with the flexible pattern interface of popular trackers and a modern sound library. It contains more than 130 carefully selected sound samples of drum set, keyboards, bass, clean, lead and rhythm guitars instruments. With Rytmik Rock Edition you can quickly and easily create the basic building block – an audio clip. It consists of musical notations for up to four instruments that you may transpose, select their location in the stereo field, and modify their volume, polyphony (with extended polyphony handling), chorus/widening stereo effect and echo. You may arbitrarily combine up to 128 such clips in four tracks and create complex pieces of music. Moreover, you have a collection of 10 pre-made compositions at your disposal from which you may quickly compose your own pieces. Rytmik Rock Edition is not only for playing with sounds; in the hands of a skilful musician it can become a serious musical instrument – surprisingly powerful pocket music station. For the best musical experience we recommend connecting headphones or a quality speaker system. You’ll become the king of the Rock party in no time..."
