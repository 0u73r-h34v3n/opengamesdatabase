Wake up with your favourite Animal Crossing music, or simply use the Nintendo DSi as a desktop clock complete with an authentic Animal Crossing background. You can even compose a Town Tune to play at the top of every hour! Customise the clock to your liking: choose from analogue or digital displays, 12-hour or 24-hour modes, and set up to three separate alarms with different Animal Crossing tunes or use your own saved sounds from the Nintendo DSi Sound application."
