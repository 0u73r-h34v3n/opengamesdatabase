	"synopsis": "Nyokki is on the loose! Nyokki is hungry! Control the nano creature Nyokki, which is wandering through each stage to consume little bits of food. Nyokki can't stop moving forward so use the L and R buttons to steer Nyokki away from barriers and other obstacles or the A button to speed up Nyokki. Avoid green globs of nano slime and nano projectiles and lasers! Consume all food before the time runs out or the Nyokki eliminator will appear, able to pass through any barriers to get to Nyokki."
