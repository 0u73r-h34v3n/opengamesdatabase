	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! Sun-Animalcule start life as eggs, emitting lights and sounds as they progress through their brief life cycle. Their pitch changes depending on where they grow. Experience their rapid growth from morning to night; when they are replaced by moon-shaped Falcato. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
