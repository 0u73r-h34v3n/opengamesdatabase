	"synopsis": "Your favorite pioneering adventure game takes you on an exciting, historic, side-scrolling adventure with your Nintendo DSiâ„¢ system. Take the Oregon Trail experience further than ever before with all of the decision-making and problem-solving fun of the original game plus additional challenges. Leave your mark on America's history. Take a picture of yourself at each landmark with the Nintendo DSi system's built-in camera. You'll have your portrait and party's name printed in the Daily Oregon Trail newspaper in the game. Play eight skill-based mini-games that will impact your resources: Hunting, Fishing, River Crossing, Rafting, Wagon Repairing, Telegraph, Berry Picking and Gold Panning. Random events faced by real pioneers - such as disease, bandits and hitchhikers - and side missions add more excitement to your westward trek."
