	"synopsis": "Nintendo first began releasing the Game & Watch series in 1980. This collection of games was available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a game and a clock. Each Game & Watch title features two modes of play: GAME A (one player) and GAME B (two players). While some controls have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the Nintendo DSi system, the appearance of the game itself has not been altered. You have a split second to decide: whack your opponent, or duck out of the way? Numbers appear on two large signs. If you think your number will be as big or bigger than your opponent’s, whack him with a mallet! Dodge if you think your number will be smaller. Earn points based on correctly whacking your opponent or dodging an attack; the first to reach 99 points wins!"
