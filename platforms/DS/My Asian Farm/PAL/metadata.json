Then your hen will lay eggs which can then be sold and with this money, you can buy new animals at the Farmers’ Market and purchase equipment from the Shopkeeper. Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses (a pagoda, a rickshaw, a guard dog, etc.) and you will be able to exchange your animals with your friends who play My Farm, My Exotic Farm, My Asian farm or My Australian Farm! • 6 kinds of animals to customise • Take care of your animals (feed, clean, protect, etc.) • Many farm improvements to buy and bonuses to collect • Exchange of animals with other players Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously released software."
