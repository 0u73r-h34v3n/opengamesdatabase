Jump across gaps between prison buildings, run through an underground station, and test your reflexes in a deadly dash over building site cranes. Reach the city centre and save your wife. Remember, you have only 24 hours. Let's hope your fitness levels can cope, because you must run! Once you have completed story mode, try to achieve the highest score in the never-ending run in six available levels: Prison, Underground, Sewers, Building Site, Suburbs and Rooftops."
