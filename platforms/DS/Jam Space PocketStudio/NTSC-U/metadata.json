Choose from two modes. Quick Jam mode allows you to lay down tracks quickly and easily using natural instrument interfaces. This is a great mode if you've got a little melody you want to record and want to get it down quickly. Studio mode gives you access to a full-featured MIDI editor that lets you tweak and hone your compositions to a professional level. If you want to dig deep and really work on that masterpiece, this is the mode for you."
