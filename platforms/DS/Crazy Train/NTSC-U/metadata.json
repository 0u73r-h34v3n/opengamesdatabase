Put on your thinking cap because hopeless train director Leon Steeltrack needs your help sending passenger and cargo trains to their correct stations! Don’t get \"sidetracked\"... as you need to make sure your trains don’t crash. Just when you think you got the hang of it, the pace increases as the speed of trains and their frequency in which they enter the game field becomes fast and furious. All of a sudden... It's railroad madness! Jump into story mode where there are over 50 levels to complete. Or take part in challenge mode where the difficulty and speed is ever increasing. With the proper concentration and practice you will become a master engineer!"
