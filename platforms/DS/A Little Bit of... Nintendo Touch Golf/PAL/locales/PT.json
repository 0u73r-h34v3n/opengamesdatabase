Nintendo Touch Golf is a realistic golf simulation that makes full use of the Touch Screen to offer in-depth control over your actions. Vary shot power, apply topspin or backspin, and more, all with a touch of the Nintendo DSi stylus. There are two main modes to choose from, for beginners and experts alike. Round Mode offers play across 3-, 9- or 18-hole courses, each with varying difficulty levels and some in an exciting tournament setting. Challenge Mode puts a unique new spin on golf, with a wide selection of special tasks to complete. By completing tasks in Challenge Mode you can improve your characterâ€™s skills, and unlock new courses in Round Mode.
