Collect dozens of different species and take good care of them at the Specimens Bank. Mix the formulas you'll need to feed your organisms at the Chemical Lab. Battle your colonies against more powerful ones to win them over and complete your collection. AfterZoom, what's hiding among your Ravioli?"
