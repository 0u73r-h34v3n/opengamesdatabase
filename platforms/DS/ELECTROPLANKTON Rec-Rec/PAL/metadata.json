	"synopsis": "Dive into a unique audio-visual experience where technology meets art. Created by multimedia musician Toshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living aquatic 'instruments' that you interact with to produce a variety of sounds and images limited only by your imagination! The fish-like Rec-Rec feed on sound waves, which they digest and then repeat back at perfect intervals, making them perfect for reproducing any sounds you like. They swim in schools of four; their frequency changes depending on how fast they swim. Use Performance mode to create your own unique compositions, or relax with Audience mode and let the Electroplankton run wild. Please note that elements of this software may have been featured in previously-released software."
